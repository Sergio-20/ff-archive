          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Story</h3>
          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p>Centuries ago, the Ancients used the Crystals of Light to build an advanced civilization and triggered a cataclysmic flood of light. Four Warriors of Darkness were selected to restore the balance, and the Ancients' civilization fell into ruin. The Gulgans predicted that history would repeat and that four Warriors of the Light would be appointed to stop a flood of darkness. </p>
          <p>Many years later, an earthquake opens up an entrance to Altar Cave near the village of Ur. Four orphaned youths under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore and find the Crystal of Wind that grants them a portion of its power and their first set of jobs, instructing them to go forth and restore world balance. </p>
          <p>In the remake, only Luneth falls into the cave and is told to find the other Warriors before being granted the Crystal's power. He and his friend Arc visit Kazus, the village cursed by the Djinn. They find Refia in Cid's airship, and all three journey to Castle Sasune to see the King and retrieve the Mythril Ring needed to break the curse. They are granted an audience by the royal guard Ingus, who becomes their fourth companion. The King tells them to rescue his daughter, Princess Sara Altney, who disappeared when the curse took hold. </p>
          <p>They enter the Sealed Cave and meet Princess Sara, who left with the ring to stop the Djinn. They defeat him and she seals him with the ring. She returns to the castle while Luneth, Arc, Refia, and Ingus are transported to the Altar Cave. The Wind Crystal appoints them Warriors of the Light and gives them their first set of Jobs. </p>
          <p>Back at Castle Sasune, Princess Sara uses the Mythril Ring to break the curse. The warriors return to Cid in Kazus. A boulder blocks the mountain pass to the rest of the continent, so he rams it with his airship forcing the party to continue with him on foot. They journey to the town of Canaan and heal Mrs. Cid of an illness, then meet a girl named Salina who mourns the disappearance of her love, Desch. Since the party needs Desch's Mini spell, they search for him on Dragon's Peak. Bahamut abducts the Warriors to feed his offspring, but they meet Desch in the dragon's nest and escape. He has lost his memory and joins the Warriors in hopes of regaining it. </p>
          <p>Using Desch's Mini spell, the group enters Tozus, the village of the gnomes. They pass through Tozus Tunnel to reach Vikings' Cove so they can acquire a ship. They find the Vikings in an uproar as their guardian, the Nepto Dragon, is on a rampage and sinking ships. The party agrees to help. They journey to the Nepto Temple and find the statue of the Nepto Dragon is missing an eye. They shrink down to traverse the tunnels inside the temple walls and find the eye in a rat's hoard. They return the eye to the statue, which calms the dragon. In gratitude, the Vikings give them the ship Enterprise. </p>
          <p>The Warriors of the Light take the Enterprise to the Village of the Ancients and learn the continent they are on is actually floating above the "surface world". They visit Gulgan Gulch where the Gulgans tell them to go to the Tower of Owen. They battle through the tower while a mysterious voice taunts them. At the top they find Medusa, servant of Xande, who threatens to destroy the tower and bring down the continent. After defeating her, Desch's memory returns and he recalls that he and his father, both Ancients, built the tower. He leaps into the furnace to repair it and save the floating continent, though the party urges him not to. </p>
          <p>The maelstrom blocking the channel north clears, so the party heads for Dwarven Hollows in search of the Fire Crystal. The dwarves are preoccupied because one of their precious ice horns was stolen by Gutsco the Rogue. The party enters the subterranean lake to recover it, making use of the Toad spell. After "defeating" him, they return to Dwarven Hallows, followed by a mysterious shadow. When they reach the main altar Gutsco reveals himself and grabs both horns. </p>
          <p>The four pursue him into the Molten Cave. They find Gutsco at the Crystal of Fire, and he absorbs its power to transform into a dragon. After defeating him a second time, the party receives the light of the Fire Crystal and several additional jobs. They obtain the Fang of Water from the Crystal and return the Horns of Ice to the dwarves. </p>
          <p>The four Warriors sail to Tokkul, a village in ruins. They learn the evil Hein, adviser to King Argus, has captured the King, enslaved the people, and uprooted the Elder Tree from the Living Woods. They are attacked and kidnapped by Hein's men and taken to Castle Hein, actually the floating Elder Tree. </p>
          <p>The Warriors of the Light defeat Hein and restore the Elder Tree, obtaining the Fang of Wind. Upon reaching Castle Argus the king thanks by giving them the Wheel of Time. They return to Cid, who uses the Wheel to remodel the Enterprise into an airship and tells the four orphans the truth about their origins. They and Cid came from the surface world on Cid's airship, which crashed on the floating continent after running into a mysterious cloud. Most of the passengers were killed, and the four orphaned infants were adopted by Ur, Kazus, and Sasune. With this knowledge, the Warriors of the Light fly the airship off the edge of the floating continent. </p>
          <p>The surface world is a swirling mess of darkness with only two visible islands. They fly the Enterprise to a wrecked ship and find an old man tending to a water priestess named Aria Benett. They give her a potion and she recovers. She recognizes them as the Warriors of the Light and joins them to restore the Water Crystal. Using a crystal shard, she opens the way to the Cave of Tides. They make their way to the crystal, and Aria returns the shard and instructs the Warriors to return the light to the crystal. As they approach, Aria pushes Luneth out of the way of an arrow. She falls, and Kraken attacks the party. The four defeat him, but Aria is mortally wounded and an earthquake strikes as the darkness dissipates, forcing them to flee. </p>
          <p>The party awakes in the town of Amur and find that Goldor has chained up their ship. They meet Four Old Men who believe themselves to be the Warriors of the Light. The party must rescue them from monsters in the sewers, and the old men repay them by helping them get Levigrass Shoes from the cantankerous Delilah. The party visits Goldor Manor to get the chain's key and meet the Earth Crystal, but Goldor spitefully shatters the crystal after his defeat. Dismayed, the party unlocks their ship and sets out, visiting several towns elsewhere. </p>
          <p>The Enterprise is shot down when they fly over the kingdom of Saronia, which is amid a civil war caused by King Gorn. The army has been ordered to fight itself and shops everywhere are closed. They find the King's son, Prince Alus, in a pub, having been banished from the castle. Arc convinces the others to aid him. They visit the castle and are granted entrance, but that night King Gorn enters the room to kill his son. Gorn plunges the knife into his stomach and frees himself from the spell placed upon him by his adviser, Gigameth. Gigameth turns into Garuda and the party defeats him. Alus is subsequently crowned as king.</p>
          <p>Scholars tell the party the airship Nautilus has been unearthed. Using it, the party flies over the Dalg Continent to Doga's Manor where they meet the sage Doga and his moogle bodyguards. Doga explains that he, Unei, and Xande were once students of the great Magus Noah. Noah granted each of a gift: Doga was given vast magic power, Unei control over the world of dreams, and Xande was granted mortality. Xande was enraged and terrified at the prospect of death and drained the Water and Earth crystals to stop the flow of time splitting the Floating Continent from the surface world. Now he wishes to kill the Warriors of the Light to do so again. </p>
          <p>The party confesses the fate of the Earth Crystal, but Doga explains the one Goldor had was a fake, and the real Earth Crystal is unharmed. He joins their party and uses Mini on them to enter the Cave of the Circle. When they reach the end of the cave, Doga uses a spell to transform the Nautilus into a submarine and tells the Warriors of the Light to go to the Temple of Time and recover Noah's Lute, which will awaken Unei from her eternal slumber. He leaves the Warriors to find the Eureka Key himself. </p>
          <p>The Warriors of the Light retrieve the lute and enter Unei's Shrine to awaken her. She gives them the Fang of Fire and tells them that the earthquake near Ur was not caused by Xande, so there must be a greater power at work. Unei joins the party and helps them excavate the Invincible, which can fly over mountains, from the Ancient Ruins. After briefing them on its capabilities, she bids them farewell and directs them to the Cave of Shadows for the final Fang.</p>
          <p>The party defeats Hecatonchier and obtains the Fang of Earth; with all four fangs they can pass the statues Xande put up to protect his headquarters and reach the Ancient's Labyrinth. They fight Titan and meet the Crystal of Earth, which gives them their final set of jobs. Doga and Unei call the Warriors back to Doga's Manor and teleport them into Doga's Grotto upon their arrival. The two sages explain that their souls are needed to activate the Keys to Eureka and the the Crystal Tower: therefore, the party must kill them. When the party tries to refuse, Doga and Unei transform into monsters and attack. After their defeat, they pass away, but not before granting each warrior a title: Luneth is the Light of Courage, Arc the Light of Kindness, Refia the Light of Affection, and Ingus the Light of Determination. </p>
          <p>The party makes their way through the Ancient Maze to enter the Crystal Tower. They unlock the doorway to the Forbidden Land of Eureka and obtain the powerful weapons they need to fight Xande. Atop the tower they find a room containing a large mirror, but when they look into it, they are paralyzed by the curse of the Five Wyrms. Doga's spirit brings the allies who fought alongside the Warriors of the Light to the tower to break the curse: Cid, Princess Sara, Desch (who survived the furnace), King Alus, and one of the Four Old Men. They wish the Warriors the best of luck and the Warriors enter the portal to the World of Darkness. </p>
          <p>The party confronts Xande, who declares he has eternal life and attacks. On his defeat, the Cloud of Darkness appears and absorbs his body, revealing that it had been manipulating Xande's actions to reduce the world to nothingness. The Cloud of Darkness kills the Warriors of the Light, but Doga and Unei sacrifice their souls to revive them. The party enters the World of Darkness and defeats the evil Guardians of the Dark Crystals, which frees the ancient Warriors of Darkness. </p>
          <p>When they face the Cloud of Darkness again, the four Warriors of the Dark sacrifice themselves to weaken the entity. The Cloud of Darkness is defeated, and the heroes and their allies return to their homes; the old man returns to Amur, Alus returns to his kingdom, and Cid and Desch return home to their lovers. Sara does not want to leave Ingus, and stays with him. Each of the heroes goes their separate ways, with Ingus and Sara returning to Castle Sasune, Refia taking up blacksmithing in Kazus, and Luneth and Arc returning to Ur. In the Famicom version the Warriors of Light return to Ur together. </p>
