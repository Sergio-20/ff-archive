          <p>Tidus is a blitzball player in a glittering metropolis known as Zanarkand. During the Memorial Cup to honor Tidus's father Jecht, a legendary player who went missing ten years ago, the stadium is destroyed by a colossal monster that attacks the city. Tidus is swept away along with Auron, a man who has been looking after him ever since Jecht went missing and Tidus's mother died, leaving him orphaned.</p>
          <p>Tidus awakens in an alien world called Spira where he meets people whose language he doesn't understand, and meets islanders whose customs he is unfamiliar with. The only thing he recognizes is blitzball, and the locals want to add him to their team after witnessing his skills. Under the care of his new friends, Tidus meets summoner Yuna who sets out on her pilgrimage to defeat Sin, the monster who had attacked Zanarkand and apparently transported Tidus into the future, as the only knowledge of Zanarkand Spirans have is a holy land that was destroyed by Sin a thousand years ago. </p>
          <p>As Yuna's pilgrimage is to end there, Tidus joins her journey as her newest guardian, alongside Auron whom he runs into later. Tidus learns that when Jecht disappeared from Zanarkand he had run into Sin and arrived in Spira, the same as has happened to him, but can hardly believe it when Auron claims that Jecht has become the monster Sin itself. </p>
          <p>During his travels Tidus falls in love with Yuna, who has attracted the attention of fellow summoners and a Maester of Yevon—the main religion in Spira—Seymour Guado. Yuna is captured and forced to marry him when Seymour becomes an unsent, a ghost whose soul should have departed to the land of Spira's afterlife: the Farplane. Tidus saves Yuna with the help of Yuna's other guardians and the Al Bhed, a tribe of Spirans who don't follow Yevon's teachings. Yuna resolves to continue the pilgrimage even after being branded a traitor. By this time Tidus has learned that if Yuna goes through with the ritual known as the Final Summoning to defeat Sin, she will die, but decides to stay by her side and support her.</p>
          <p>Tidus is contacted by the fayth and learns the Zanarkand he hails from is but a dream of the fayth willed into being by an ancient summoner called Yu Yevon who created Sin as his armor a thousand years ago. The fayth ask Tidus to fell Yu Yevon so they can stop dreaming, and Tidus decides to help despite knowing that if the dream ends, he will disappear. In the ruins of the real Zanarkand, Yuna discovers the truth behind the Final Summoning: she must choose one of her guardians to become a fayth for the Final Aeon, but even if she were to succeed Yu Yevon would make the Final Aeon into a new Sin. This is how the current incarnation of Sin is actually Jecht, Tidus's father. After arriving in Spira Jecht had become a guardian for Lord Braska, Yuna's father, and offered to become his Final Aeon. The party learns that Auron was killed by Yu Yevon's unsent daughter Yunalesca when he sought to avenge Jecht and Braska, and has been wandering as an unsent ever since. Yuna, meanwhile, declares the Final Summoning a false rite and refuses to go through with it. </p>
          <p>Using the Al Bhed's airship the party attacks Sin head on and ventures inside it, where they find Jecht in his Final Aeon form who asks Tidus to destroy him. Afterward Yu Yevon manifests and the party kills him. Yuna sends Auron, the aeons, and Sin to the Farplane. The fayth statues lose their power, and Dream Zanarkand and all its inhabitants, Tidus included, disappear from Spira.</p>
