          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p>Noctis Lucis Caelum travels to Altissia, the capital city of Accordo, where he is to wed his childhood friend, Lady Lunafreya, as part of the terms of a peace treaty introduced by Niflheim. En route, Noctis learns the empire has attacked his home, the Crown City of Insomnia, killed his father and stolen Lucis's Crystal. Together with his friends—Ignis Scientia, Gladiolus Amicitia, and Prompto Argentum—Noctis seeks out Cor Leonis, a member of the Crownsguard who tasks him with retrieving the weapons of his ancestors, which will grant the power necessary for reclaiming the throne. Noctis meets the suspicious chancellor of Niflheim, Ardyn Izunia, and visits the Disc of Cauthess, the resting place of the Astral Titan. After completing Titan's trial, Noctis learns the Archaean was encouraged to forge a covenant with him by Lunafreya, who is an Oracle able to talk to the gods. </p>
          <p>In Duscae, Noctis is aided by Gentiana, a High Messenger of the gods onto mankind, to make a pact with Ramuh. As their journey continues, Noctis and his friends notice the nights get longer and daemons appear more frequently. This is because of the Starscourge, a plague that brings forth darkness.</p>
          <p>When Noctis reaches Altissia, Lunafreya rouses Leviathan, who goes on a rampage. Ardyn disrupts the rite by stabbing Lunafreya, but she still empowers Noctis by calling upon the past kings of Lucis who lend Noctis their power, enabling him to defeat the Hydraean. In a dream he has while unconscious, Noctis is visited by Lunafreya's spirit who gives him the Ring of the Lucii. The ring is a royal heirloom said to be of divine provenance that houses the spirits of the past kings of Lucis that lends the old kings' power to the current king. When Noctis awakens, a blinded Ignis confirms Lunafreya has died. The two reunite with Gladiolus and Prompto, and board a train bound for Gralea, the capital of Niflheim, in hopes of reclaiming the stolen Crystal. Noctis's mission evolves from simply reclaiming Lucis, to saving the world from the darkness of the Starscourge, as without Lunafreya's powers as the Oracle the world is being plunged into an endless night. Noctis hopes to use the light of the Crystal to combat it. </p>
          <p>On his way to Tenebrae, the home of the Oracles' bloodline, Noctis is tricked by Ardyn into pushing Prompto off the train. Noctis learns Lunafreya's contact with the Astrals was slowly killing her, and he receives Shiva's blessing from Gentiana, who reveals herself to be the Glacian in human form. In Gralea, Noctis is separated from Ignis and Gladiolus, and infiltrates Zegnautus Keep alone with the Ring of the Lucii as his only weapon. Noctis is haunted by Ardyn's disembodied voice as he reunites with his allies and rescues Prompto. The foursome comes face-to-face with Emperor Aldercapt, who has been turned into a daemon. </p>
          <p>Noctis reluctantly leaves his allies behind to approach the Crystal, believing it has the power to destroy daemons. He is absorbed inside it, and transported to the Astral Realm where he learns from Bahamut he is the prophesied True King. He could end the Starscourge by eliminating Ardyn, a Lucian healer from 2,000 years ago who became corrupted and made immortal by daemonic influence.</p>
          <p>Noctis returns to the mortal realm a decade later, and joins with Ignis, Gladiolus, and Prompto to confront Ardyn in the ruins of Insomnia. Noctis defeats Ardyn in a climatic duel, ascends the throne, and gives his life to end the eternal night that has consumed Eos by channeling the power of the past kings and the Crystal's light. Returning to the Astral Realm, Noctis teams up with Lunafreya and his ancestors to destroy Ardyn's spirit. The True King and the Ring of the Lucii fade away as peace is restored to the world. The sun rises, daemons disappear, and the spirits of Noctis and Lunafreya fall asleep on the Lucian throne. </p>
