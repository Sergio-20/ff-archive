          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Story</h3>
          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p>Queen Brahne of Alexandria begins her conquest of the Mist Continent while her daughter Princess Garnet escapes the kingdom with a thief from a theater troupe, Zidane Tribal. They discover Brahne is building an army of black mages with the aid of a mysterious man called Kuja and try to stop her, but after Garnet falls into Brahne's hands the latter extracts the mythical entities of unimaginable power from her: eidolons. The discarded Garnet escapes with Zidane and his friends' help.</p>
          <p>Learning Kuja is the one who supplies Brahne with the technology to manufacture black mages the party tracks him down at the Outer Continent. They meet a young summoner girl, the last of the tribe of summoners, and learn Garnet hails from the village of Madain Sari that lies in ruins with Eiko and Garnet being the last summoners in the world. They investigate the colossal Iifa Tree that towers over the landscape and discover it exists to stop the souls of Gaian beings from returning to the crystal at the planet's core, a process that is depriving the planet of Gaia of its life energy. </p>
          <p>When Kuja enslaves the eidolon Bahamut Brahne summons against him, the queen perishes while apologizing to Garnet. As Garnet succeeds the throne of Alexandria, the Alexandrian armies withdraw from the kingdoms they had conquered. Kuja demolishes Alexandria with Bahamut, but Garnet and Eiko join to summon the most powerful eidolon in living memory—Alexander—who obliterates Bahamut. When Kuja calls forth the airship Invincible to enslave Alexander, his plans are foiled by his master Garland who destroys Alexander and Kuja is left without an eidolon.</p>
          <p>Kuja schemes to overthrow Garland to rule both Gaia and the mysterious world of Terra from where they hail from. When Zidane and his friends pursue him, Kuja learns of the power of Trance, a powerful surge of emotions that momentarily enhances ones inner capabilities. Now knowing of the world of Terra, Zidane and his friends open a portal there, and discover Terra is a dead planet that exists on the inside of Gaia from where Garland, Kuja and Zidane himself originate. Upon learning of his true origin as Garland's "angel of death" created to incite destruction on Gaia so that the world of Terra can one day assimilate it, Zidane suffers a mental breakdown. His friends help him come round and they confront Garland who is killed by Kuja who has entered Trance by absorbing the souls held within the Invincible. Upon learning Garland placed a limit on his life and that he will soon die, Kuja goes berserk and decides to destroy the world. </p>
          <p>The party follows Kuja to the depths of Memoria made manifest by the the memories held by the lives lived on Gaia, whose souls manifest as Mist as they are expelled by the Iifa Tree via its roots. They travel back in time to find the crystal that is the origin of the universe. They stop Kuja and face Necron, the embodiment of death itself whom they convince that despite Kuja's actions life doesn't yearn for death. Returning to Gaia with Kuja's teleportation spell, the others depart, but Zidane stays behind to look for Kuja. Kuja perishes and Zidane is not heard from again until some time later when everyone gathers in Alexandria to watch the play I Want to Be Your Canary. An actor in the play casts off his cloak revealing a returning Zidane, and he is reunited with Queen Garnet while all their friends watch on from the audience. </p>
