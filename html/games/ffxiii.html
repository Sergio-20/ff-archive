          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Story</h3>
          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p>Cocoon is plunged into chaos when a Pulse fal'Cie is discovered in an old Pulsian landmark in the town of Bodhum. Fearing that anyone that has been in its vicinity might now be a l'Cie servant of a hostile fal'Cie from another world, Cocoon's governing body enacts a Purge to remove everyone who happened to be in Bodhum during the fal'Cie's discovery. At the center of these events is Serah Farron, a local girl who had unwittingly wandered into the vestige and been made a l'Cie and is now held captive by the fal'Cie therein.</p>
          <p>Serah's sister Lightning sets out to save her amid the Purge, and ends up rendezvousing with various allies of circumstance before the abode of the fal'Cie Anima: Serah's fiance Snow and two youths caught up in the Purge he's been protecting, Hope and Vanille, and a gun-wielding airship pilot Sazh. As they locate Serah she crystallizes after asking Lightning to save Cocoon. Believing Serah to be dead, Lightning leads an attack on the fal'Cie Anima who briefly transports the group into another realm. They come face-to-face with the god Pulse that brands everyone a l'Cie, showing them a vision of the mythical beast Ragnarok destroying Cocoon. Back in the real world, the group must come to terms with being unwittingly been made enemies of Cocoon, as if they don't follow the path set out for them by the fal'Cie, they will be turned into mindless monsters known as Cie'th.</p>
          <p>The members of the group react to their predicament in various ways: Snow makes protecting Serah's crystal his priority; Lightning sets upon a path of revenge against Cocoon's governing body, the Sanctum, and all fal'Cie with Hope, who views her as a role model, following suit; while Sazh and Vanille choose to run from their fate. They learn Vanille is harboring a secret of having been a l'Cie from Pulse all along, and she and her friend Fang—who joins their group—were involved in the war between the two worlds over six hundred years ago, sleeping through the centuries in crystal stasis. After settling their differences the party decides to work together to stop the fal'Cie's plan, and gain the help of a rogue army regiment, the Cavalry, that posits their wish is to free Cocoon from fal'Cie rule.</p>
          <p>The l'Cie learn everything was a ruse set up by the fal'Cie who have been manipulating their every action from the shadows. The fal'Cie's ultimate purpose for Cocoon is to be a "farm" for human souls, which the fal'Cie wish to expend to summon a god they call the Maker from another realm. Trying to protect Cocoon despite it going against their Focus, the l'Cie gather in the fal'Cie Orphan's resting place, the fal'Cie that powers all the other fal'Cie in Cocoon. As the party learns Orphan shares the other fal'Cie's goal to sacrifice the citizens of Cocoon, they conclude there is no way for mankind and fal'Cie to co-exist. The party declares their true Focus is to save Cocoon and kill Orphan. As Cocoon falls from the sky Fang and Vanille summon the mythical beast Ragnarok to erect a crystal pillar to sustain Cocoon above Gran Pulse, and the world is saved.</p>
