          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Short Intro</h3>
          <p>Snow Villiers (スノウ・ヴィリアース Sunō Viriāsu) is a 21-year-old human from Cocoon. Snow proposes to Serah Farron two days prior to the start of Final Fantasy XIII. During the Purge (a mass exodus of Cocoon citizens after the activation of the Pulse fal'Cie Anima),[92] Snow and his group NORA[93] engages in a battle with PSICOM, the security force of Cocoon. After becoming a l'Cie and finding Serah in crystal stasis, he despairs and is forced to tame his Eidolon, the Shiva Sisters. After meeting up with Cid Raines and Oerba Yun Fang, Snow pairs up with Hope while oblivious to the boy's grudge against him. Once Hope gets Snow alone, he unsuccessfully tries to murder him for his part in his mother's death and reconciles with him soon after. Snow then reconciles with Lightning and receives forgiveness from Hope's father.[94] He and the others then rescue Sazh and Vanille before eventually escaping to Gran Pulse, where Lightning and Snow resolve to see Serah together after destroying Orphan.[95] After Orphan's death, Snow and Lightning reunite with Serah, then start planning to set up a new town on Gran Pulse.[96]</p>
          <p>In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Snow left a year prior to its events promising Serah to find Lightning for her. His search would eventually result with him traveling through time while seeing Lightning in a dream telling him to protect the crystal pillar holding Cocoon, seeing a vision of the world's fate, and becoming a l'Cie once more with the Focus of fighting beside Serah at the final battle.[97] Appearing on Cocoon three hundred years in his future, Snow attempts to destroy a monster threatening Cocoon's supporting pillar. Serah and Noel come to Snow's aid and help him defeat it by negating the anomaly causing its growth. With the threat gone, Snow entrusts Noel with Serah's care and dissolves from the moment in time while promising Serah that they will meet again.[98] Snow then travels to the Coliseum, a fighting arena separated from the flow of time,[99] and after Serah and Noel challenge him to combat and win, he is forced to remain due to being bound to the Coliseum by the Chaos. </p>
          <p>In Lightning Returns, after being released from his imprisonment, Snow meets up with Noel and Hope before coming upon the city of Yusnaan and becomes its protector and patron.[100] Over the next five hundred years, he becomes jaded and depressed, brooding on Serah's death and being weighed down by guilt at his inability to stop the world decaying.[101] When Lightning meets up with him, his changed appearance and attitude makes her fear that he has gone insane.[102] When they next meet, Snow reveals his intention to absorb a massive cloud of Chaos at the center of Yusnaan's palace, transform into a Cie'th and have Lightning kill him as a punishment for his failure.[103] He performs this act and Lightning does battle him, but she manages to reverse the transformation and convince him to keep hoping and help guide Serah to the new world.[104]</p>

          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Concept and Creation</h3>
          <p>Snow was designed by Nao Ikeda and Tetsuya Nomura. He was designed around a motif of ice,[15] with his bandanna inspired by an unused costume element from Kingdom Hearts coded designed by Kamikokuryo.[105][106] For XIII-2, the bandanna was removed and he was given a new hairstyle.[106] Originally to have been called "Storm",[107] the development team nicknamed the character "Mr. 33 cm" in reference to his shoe size while his name was still a secret.[108] Nomura designed his darker look in Lightning Returns.[32] Snow's personality in XIII, which carried over to XIII-2, was created to be passionate, optimistic and impulsive, opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning's cold mannerisms.[109][110] He has also been described in interviews as the "tough guy" type, and not having a jealous side to him.[111][112] He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type, but this was changed to his "big brother" persona.[113] Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns, Kitase described Snow as "struggling with all his might to keep himself from falling apart from the sadness of losing Serah."[114] His design was intended to reflect the state of the world, as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world's fate.[115] His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic.[116] Watanabe enjoyed writing the character's story, as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared "cool", rather than taking on "thankless" roles.[39] VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope, and the way he coped with Serah's fate, one of the most interesting aspects of the original game.[117] Aside from his appearance in the XIII games, the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII,[118] and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn along with Lightning's Guardian Corps uniform.[119] Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese.[56][57][58]</p>

          <hr/>
          <h2 class="text-center text-light">Story Ahead. Contains Spoilers.</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Two days later PSICOM Purges the people in Bodhum, deeming the civilians "contaminated" with exposure to a Pulse fal'Cie. The Vestige is taken to the Hanging Edge with the fal'Cie and Serah still inside. While Snow and NORA engage PSICOM as a resistance force, Lightning and her ally of circumstance, Sazh Katzroy, derail their Purge train. Snow and NORA rescue the remaining Purgees, some of whom volunteer to help fight the Sanctum, including a woman named Nora Estheim. Snow leads the attack and Nora saves Snow from a Havoc Skytank. As it goes down, it destroys the bridge they are standing on and mortally wounds Nora. </p>
          <p>As they hang from the bridge's edge Nora begs Snow to "get him home" before dying and falling from his grasp. Unknown to Snow, her son, Hope Estheim, watches the scene from afar and blames Snow for his mother's death. Snow returns to the rest of NORA and the surviving Purgees and rides an airbike to the Vestige. Hope and his companion, Vanille, follow him, and after saving the pair from a Cie'th ambush, Snow has the two stick with him. Snow makes his way to Anima's Throne and finds Lightning and Sazh already there, along with Serah. </p>
          <p>Serah asks Lightning to save Cocoon and crystallizes, a tear-shaped crystal falling from her grasp into Snow's hand. This bewilders the group, as turning into crystal means a l'Cie has completed their Focus. Snow remains optimistic, as the legends state l'Cie who complete their Focus gain eternal life, but Lightning believes Serah to be dead. Snow begs Anima to return Serah, offering to become a l'Cie in her stead, but Lightning and Sazh—who has his own motive for hunting down the fal'Cie—attack it. Snow joins their plight only to be branded a l'Cie along with everyone else. As the PSICOM blasts the Vestige apart it releases an energy wave that destroys the Hanging Edge and falls down to Lake Bresha, crystallizing it on impact. </p>
          <p>Snow awakens with the rest of the group in Lake Bresha, unscathed, believing Serah had kept them from harm. They try to discern their Focus from a hazy vision they shared, but only recognize the legendary beast Ragnarok is somehow involved. While the others believe their Focus is to destroy Cocoon, Snow believes it is to save it as Serah had asked. </p>
          <p>Now enemies of the state, they evade pursuing PSICOM troops by crossing the crystallized lake when they come across Serah's crystallized form lodged in a formation. While the others keep moving to evade the army, Snow stays to dig Serah's crystal out. When PSICOM attacks him Snow's Eidolon, the Shiva Sisters, is summoned. </p>
          <p>After taming them, he is apprehended by Cavalry troops being led by another Pulse l'Cie named Fang. Along with Serah's crystal, Snow is taken aboard the Cavalry airship, the Lindblum, where he meets their leader, Cid Raines, who reveals his mission to free Cocoon from the fal'Cie rule. Raines claims the new l'Cie have been sentenced to public execution should they be caught, and with Serah's crystallized form aboard the Lindblum, Snow has no choice but to comply and help them. </p>
          <p>When Lightning and Hope are tracked down in Hope's hometown of Palumpolum, Snow and Fang intercept PSICOM's assault on them. They split up: Snow with Hope, and Fang with Lightning, and decide on Hope's home in Felix Heights as a rendezvous point. As Snow and Hope travel through the town Snow remains oblivious to Hope's hatred for him and unknowingly continues to fuel the boy's rage with every word he says. </p>
          <p>When they spot PSICOM rounding up more people to Purge, Snow tries to save them by announcing his l'Cie status and firing a gun into the air to make them scatter, but the crowd returns as an angry mob. After escaping to the Rivera Towers and fighting an Ushumgal Subjugator, Hope confronts Snow about his mother's death and blasts him off a building's roof. Ready to kill him, Hope approaches Snow with Lightning's knife revealing himself as Nora's son. A PSICOM missile attack hits the building and knocks Hope out, sending him plummeting over the edge. Snow catches him midair and shields him with his body as the two fall to the streets below. </p>
          <p>An injured Snow carries an unconscious Hope on his back to fulfill his promise to Nora to get her son home. When Hope awakes Snow apologizes for endangering Nora and being unable to save her. He returns Lightning's knife giving Hope a second chance for revenge, but the latter realizes he wanted revenge for the wrong reasons. The Ushumgal Subjugator returns and knocks Snow unconscious as he tries to protect Hope who fights the beast alone until being joined by Lightning and Fang, and the three destroy the monster together. Afterward, the group heads to Hope's home. </p>
          <p>At Hope's apartment Lightning tends to Snow's wounds and the two make amends after Lightning apologizes for how she treated him. Snow apologizes to Hope's father, Bartholomew Estheim, for his hand in Nora's death, which Bartholomew accepts upon learning of Snow fulfilling her dying wish. After Bartholomew exposes several flaws in the l'Cie's plan to take down the Sanctum, PSICOM attacks the apartment. Snow faces the troops, imploring them to realize he is a human like them and they all wish to protect Cocoon. He is rebutted by general Yaag Rosch, who claims the l'Cie's lives are not worth the risk of sparing. The party is saved by Rygdea from the Cavalry and taken aboard the Lindblum. </p>
          <p>With the Cavalry's help the group infiltrates the PSICOM airship, the Palamecia, upon learning Sazh and Vanille are being held captive onboard. They fight their way through and reunite with the prisoners before facing Sanctum's leader, Primarch Galenth Dysley, in his true form, the fal'Cie Barthandelus. He claims their Focus is to become Ragnarok and destroy Orphan, the fal'Cie that keeps Cocoon afloat. Snow is shocked to hear Dysley's claim that Serah's Focus was to assemble them to be made l'Cie and bring about Cocoon's destruction. </p>
          <p>Under Barthandelus's manipulation they escape the Palamecia to the Fifth Ark where Snow remains in a state of shock. While in the Ark the group runs into Cid Raines, who is revealed to be a Sanctum l'Cie branded by Barthandelus with a Focus to help them destroy Cocoon, and that their journey had been orchestrated by Barthandelus since the beginning. Determined to defy his Focus and save Cocoon, Cid attacks the party. He is defeated, but turns into a crystal anyway. Snow is inspired by Cid's sacrifice, realizing they can defy their fate and fight to save Cocoon. After Fang tames her Eidolon, Bahamut, the group finds an airship and descends to Gran Pulse, the world outside Cocoon, in hopes of finding answers. </p>
          <p>Making a base camp in the Vallis Media, they search Pulse for days but find it devoid of human life. After Hope brings Alexander under his control, everyone decides to head to Fang and Vanille's old village of Oerba. They cross the Archylte Steppe, the Mah'habara Subterra and the Sulyya Springs, where Snow learns from Vanille she had met Serah. Vanille tells him Serah had the same vision of Ragnarok and must have overcome her Focus, meaning Dysley lied about it, but Snow tells Vanille he already knows. In the Skyreach, Lightning and Snow discuss Serah and promise to see her again together. </p>
          <p>The party ascends the floors of Taejin's Tower and rides a capsule down to Oerba. The dilapidated ruins hold little answers for them and on a run-down bridge Serah appears reciting the legend of Ragnarok, telling the party to destroy Orphan and save the world. She is revealed to be another of Dysley's illusions and after the second battle with Barthandelus, they resolve to protect Orphan and return to Cocoon, where Dysley has resurrected Cid Raines as the new Primarch and thus set the stage for civil war. </p>
          <p>Sazh pilots an airship into the Eden Grand Prix. After saving a racer with the Shiva Sisters, Snow accidentally shows his l'Cie brand to the crowd and chaos breaks out. The city is overrun by Pulsian machines and monsters from the Fifth Ark, and as the party fights through the chaos toward Edenhall, Snow is briefly reunited with the other members of NORA. They scold him for leaving them behind and promise to support Snow regardless if he has become a l'Cie before leaving to help the populace. Snow and the others reach Edenhall and its heart, Orphan's Cradle. </p>
          <p>In the Narthex Throne Barthandelus shatters a crystallized Serah. Snow is enraged but through Lightning's help remembers he has Serah's crystal tear, seeing through the illusion. Barthandelus is defeated and merges with Orphan who demands they turn into Ragnarok and Fang succumbs to its demands. Snow and Sazh try to hold Fang back, but her assault on the party transforms everyone but Vanille into Cie'th. Fang's incomplete Ragnarok fails to destroy Orphan, and after Vanille refuses to follow Fang's example, Orphan explodes and sinks into a pool of silver liquid. Snow and the others return to normal claiming they have seen a new Focus, deeming their transformation more fal'Cie smoke and mirrors. Lightning calls out their Focus is to save Cocoon and the party's l'Cie brands turn white. They defeat Orphan in its true form and Cocoon begins to fall from the sky. </p>
          <p>Fang and Vanille become Ragnarok and save Cocoon by encasing it in crystal and forming a crystal pillar to support it above Gran Pulse. Their Focus complete, Snow is crystallized down on Pulse alongside the rest of the party. Everyone apart from Fang and Vanille inside the crystal pillar awaken from their crystal stasis briefly after with their l'Cie brands gone. Serah and Sazh's son Dajh are released from crystal stasis as well, and Snow is reunited with his fiancée. As Lightning begins to apologize to Serah, Snow cuts in saying they have a wedding to plan. He promises to make Serah happy and Lightning congratulates the couple. </p>
