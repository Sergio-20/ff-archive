          <p>Sazh Katzroy (サッズ・カッツロイ Sazzu Kattsuroi) is a 40-year-old human former airship pilot. His son, Dajh, is taken by the Sanctum in the aftermath of him becoming a Cocoon l'Cie three days earlier when Sazh bought him a chocobo chick.[130] Along with Lightning, he derails the train carrying the Cocoon exiles at the start of Final Fantasy XIII. After the party splits up following Anima's defeat, Sazh goes with Vanille as he tells her about his son. However, Jihl Nabaat reveals Vanille's part in his son becoming a l'Cie, causing him to summon the Eidolon Brynhildr. Unable to kill Vanille, Sazh unsuccessfully attempts suicide. Sazh and Vanille are then captured by Nabaat. Before Lightning's party rescues Sazh and Vanille, he reconciles with her for her role in Dajh's fate.[131] After traveling to Pulse, Sazh eventually forgives Fang for what happened to Dajh. After Vanille and Fang transform to Ragnarok and prevent Cocoon from colliding with Pulse, Sazh is reunited with Dajh. </p>
          <p>After these events, Sazh leaves to help the civilians of Cocoon,[132] then decides to move onto Gran Pulse. At some point during the events of XIII-2, Sazh is sucked through a rip in time, is separated from Dajh and ends up in Serendipity, a palace in the Void Beyond.[133] While there, he meets Chocolina and learns of the fate facing the world from Serendipity's owner. Reuniting with Dajh and deciding to fight no matter what the future holds, they go through a time gate and help Serah and Noel in their battle against Caius.[134] Sazh then helps Hope save Fang and Vanille from the crystal pillar before Cocoon falls. In Lightning Returns, Sazh has set up his home in the Wildlands. After Dajh's soul is lost and his body falls into a coma, Sazh becomes tormented by his seeming failure to protect his son.[135][136] Lightning helps retrieve the fragments of Dajh's soul, lifting Sazh's burden. </p>
          <p>In the May 2009 edition of Official PlayStation Magazine, Yoshinori Kitase said that Sazh was intended to be an Eddie Murphy-style comic-relief character as well as a sympathetic character.[137] Toriyama was initially worried about the unconventional afro hairstyle. Due to the character having the largest amount of dialogue in the game, an experienced voice actor was chosen for him.[138] His early look was, as revealed in the a special Ultimania guide released during 25th anniversary celebrations for the series, very different from his final design, with him being white with long brown hair, and wielding a shoulder-cannon rather than machine pistols. He was also named "Baz".[17] He is voiced by Reno Wilson in English and by Masashi Ebara in Japanese.[56][57][58]</p>

          <hr/>
          <h2 class="text-center text-light">Story Ahead. Contains Spoilers.</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Sazh and Lightning derail the Purge train and set the Purgees free. The two fight their way through the Hanging Edge to the Pulse Vestige, where the Pulse fal'Cie Anima sleeps. When they reach Anima's Throne other wayward Purgees—Snow, Vanille, and Hope—unexpectedly join them. They find Lightning's sister Serah, a Pulse l'Cie, who enters crystal stasis after asking Lightning to save Cocoon. </p>
          <p>As they confront Anima the fal'Cie turns the group into l'Cie before they are cast down into the crystallized Lake Bresha. When they awaken, Sazh prompts the others to determine their Focus, but their only clue is a shared vision of the mythical beast Ragnarok destroying Cocoon. After leaving Snow behind with Serah's crystal, the group of four continues through the lake and finds an old airship, but once Sazh attempts to pilot them to safety they are shot down by PSICOM and crash-land in the Vile Peaks. </p>
          <p>After Lightning and Hope continue on to throw off pursuit, Sazh vows not to abandon Vanille. They find Hope by himself further ahead after he was left behind by Lightning. Promising to get Hope back home to his father in Palumpolum, Sazh and Vanille have him travel with them until Lightning rejoins the party. </p>
          <p>When Lightning reveals her plan to go to Eden and destroy its namesake fal'Cie, Sazh is outraged for her wanting to "snuff out Cocoon" now that everyone hunts her down, though Lightning assures she only wishes to take down the Sanctum. She leaves with Hope chasing after her, leaving Sazh and Vanille behind. They decide to run in the opposite direction to stay out of Lightning's way and escape their fate. </p>
          <p>Sazh and Vanille continue their flight to the Sunleth Waterscape and while crossing it, Vanille asks Sazh about his family. Sazh explains what happened to Dajh, revealing his motives for boarding the Purge train. Sazh wonders if Dajh's Focus would be to destroy all Pulse l'Cie, which would mean Sazh and his companions must die to spare Dajh. </p>
          <p>Waiting for a ship to Nautilus, Sazh tells Vanille he didn't always hate Pulse and found the Sanctum's claims about incoming attacks from the lowerworld suspicious. He believes the trouble started because Dajh detected Anima in Bodhum, but Vanille implores him to place the blame elsewhere: onto the Pulse l'Cie responsible for the Euride incident. </p>
          <p>In Nautilus, the pair attends the Eidolon parade, the Pompa Sancta. Visiting the Chocobo Corral, Sazh reveals he wishes to surrender to PSICOM to see Dajh one last time even if it means his own execution. Vanille tries to dissuade him by divulging who is responsible for the Euride Gorge incident, but before she can reveal the culprit, the army attacks from above. Despite his earlier wishes to be captured, Sazh protects Vanille and aids her escape. </p>
          <p>They are chased through the Mall to the Clock Tower where Dajh appears and crystallizes in Sazh's arms. Nabaat arrives with her troops, and the boy's Focus is revealed: to capture servants of the lowerworld fal'Cie. Nabaat shows Sazh a security recording from Euride Gorge, which reveals Vanille and her friend Fang were the Pulse l'Cie who disturbed the fal'Cie Kujata, and caused it to turn Dajh into a l'Cie to protect itself. Vanille flees deeper into Nautilus and Sazh pursues her as Nabaat is curious as to how much data they could collect watching two l'Cie fight, under the assumption that Sazh will kill Vanille. </p>
          <p>When Sazh finds Vanille at the Fiendlord's Keep, he aims his pistol at her while Vanille begs him to shoot her for all the suffering she has caused him. Sazh is furious she thinks all will be forgiven once she is dead, and his anguish summons his Eidolon, Brynhildr. Seeing Vanille is willing to protect him, Sazh tames the Eidolon with her. </p>
          <p>After Brynhildr vanishes, Sazh points his pistol back at Vanille but realizes killing her will not change anything. He places the pistol to his head but is unable to take his own life. They are captured by PSICOM and Nabaat taunts Sazh with the prospect of putting Dajh's crystal up for display as a monument in Eden before rendering Sazh unconscious. Vanille and the unconscious Sazh are taken into an airship by Nabaat's regiment, and imprisoned on the Palamecia to be transported to Eden for a public execution. </p>
          <p>Upon the Palamecia, Sazh learns about Vanille's past and her recent awakening from crystal stasis. Vanille is a Pulse l'Cie from hundreds of years ago who had entered crystal stasis alongside Fang. The pair's crystals had been placed inside the Vestige that had ended up in Bodhum when Cocoon had looted Pulse for raw materials. When the two had awoken they had found themselves in Cocoon. After being separated from Fang in the wake of the Euride incident, Vanille has been running from her fate. </p>
          <p>Vanille's story sparks a flicker of hope in Sazh for his son, hoping that Dajh, too, could awaken one day. With a new reason to fight, Sazh helps Vanille overpower the guards. They break out of the cell, retrieve their weapons, and reunite with Lightning, Snow, Hope, and Fang, who have teamed up to rescue them. The reunited l'Cie confront Primarch Galenth Dysley, the head of the Sanctum government, who is also on the ship.</p>
          <p>After he kills Nabaat and reveals himself as the fal'Cie Barthandelus, Dysley claims the party's collective Focus is to become Ragnarok, a mythical beast of destruction, and destroy Cocoon by killing Orphan, the fal'Cie that keeps Cocoon afloat. Sazh attempts to guide an airship off the Palamecia as it descends, but an unknown force drives it towards the Fifth Ark hidden beneath Eden instead. </p>
          <p>The party travels through the ark and their l'Cie powers are fully awoken. Deeper inside the party encounters the Cavalry leader Cid Raines who had helped Lightning, Snow, Fang and Hope save Sazh and Vanille under the pretense the l'Cie must help him liberate Cocoon from fal'Cie rule. Raines reveals himself a Sanctum l'Cie branded by Barthandelus with the Focus of helping them destroy Cocoon, but he is willing to sacrifice himself to defy it and attacks the party. The party defeats Raines who turns to crystal despite having defied his Focus, inspiring them to do the same. After Fang tames her Eidolon Bahamut, a path to the ark's lower levels is revealed. They party finds a Pulsian airship and a gate leading to Gran Pulse, where they hope to find answers on how to remove their l'Cie brands. </p>
          <p>Sazh pilots the airship to the world below and it is attacked by a wild wyvern. After an emergency landing, the party sets up a base camp in the Vallis Media. They search Gran Pulse for days but find no signs of human life, and decide to head for Oerba, Fang and Vanille's hometown. </p>
          <p>In the Font of Namva in the Archylte Steppe, Fang apologizes to Sazh for her involvement in Dajh's branding. He accepts her apology and admits his fault in letting Dajh out of his sight. The group travels through the Mah'habara Subterra and hitches a ride on the fal'Cie Atomos to the Sulyya Springs. They reach the top of Taejin's Tower and ride a capsule down to Oerba were the party finds Dysley has incited a civil war in Cocoon to bring it down, and decides to return there. </p>
          <p>Sazh pilots the airship Dysley had left for them to the Eden Grand Prix, where he rides Brynhildr in her Gestalt Mode. Dysley uses the Fifth Ark to release Pulsian monsters and weapons into Eden and cause mass panic. At Orphan's Cradle the l'Cie confront Barthandelus, who conjures and shatters Dajh's and Serah's crystals hoping to kill their morale, but Sazh presses on in the knowledge it is but another of the fal'Cie's illusions. </p>
          <p>After Barthandelus is defeated, he merges with the fal'Cie Orphan. Fang succumbs to Orphan's demands and decides to become Ragnarok and everyone but Fang and Vanille turn to Cie'th. They relive the memories of their journey together and revert in time to save Fang from the exploding Orphan's clutches. Sazh voices his belief that their transformation into Cie'th was "more fal'Cie smoke and mirrors" and that they have witnessed something that resembled a new Focus. </p>
          <p>The party bands together to defeat Orphan's final form with the hope that with the power to destroy Cocoon, they also have the power to save it. After declaring saving Cocoon their true Focus the party's l'Cie brands burn out. After Orphan is defeated, Orphan's Cradle disappears and the party is left floating above Eden as Cocoon falls. As Sazh, Lightning, Hope, and Snow float away and start to crystallize, Fang and Vanille become Ragnarok to crystallize Cocoon and erect a crystal pillar to support it over Pulse. Sazh is crystallized on Gran Pulse along with the rest of the party. They shortly awaken and find their l'Cie brands wiped clean. Dajh and Serah approach them from Cocoon as its people evacuate, and father and son are reunited. </p>
