          <p>Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII (レギス・ルシス・チェラム113世 Regisu Rushisu Cheramu Hyakujūsansei) is the king of Lucis and Noctis's father, being a key character in Final Fantasy XV and Brotherhood, as well a protagonist in Kingsglaive and an antagonist in Episode Ardyn. As the ruling king of Lucis, he safeguards the Crystal and protects Insomnia using a magical barrier called the Wall using the hereditary Ring of the Lucii. Maintaining the Wall drains Regis of his life energy, causing him to age rapidly.[45][46] In Brotherhood, it is revealed that Regis fought off the Daemon that almost killed Noctis, but the two become estranged due to Regis's failing health to meet the Wall's energy demands.[47][48][49] When Regis accepted Niflheim's peace offer despite knowing it is a trap, he sends Noctis away from Insomnia from the chaos that would ensue in the events of Kingsglaive.[50] Losing the Ring of the Lucii when it was cut from his hand by Niflheim's General Glauca, Regis dies fighting the general despite Lunafreya and Nyx Ulric trying to save him.[51] Regis reappears as one of the Lucii—the spirits of past Lucian kings bound to the Ring of the Lucii—when Noctis sacrifices himself to end the Starscourge and destroy Ardyn, delivering the final blow that destroys Noctis' life force.[52]</p>
          <p>A character carried over from Versus XIII, Regis underwent a major redesign during development, becoming an older character in appearance. This was due to Regis's expanding role in Kingsglaive and the new technology available. The development team wanted to create a more expressive character and aged him to properly convey his stature as a king. Due to this, his in-game incarnation was redesigned to better fit with his portrayal in Kingsglaive.[29] The redesign was also chosen as his original design no longer fit into the reworked story of Final Fantasy XV.[53] As with the rest of Lucis' royalty, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance.[54] Regis' motion capture and physical model were provided by British actor Jon Campling.[55]</p>

          <h2 class="text-center text-light">Story Ahead. Contains Spoilers.</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Regis was born in M.E. 706. His father was King Mors and he was to be the 113th king of Lucis. </p>
          <p>During the Great War the Niflheim army further breached the Lucian regions of Leide, Duscae, and Cleigne where they began to establish bases. Lucis challenged the empire, but was pushed back. In M.E. 725, Prince Regis fought alongside Cid Sophiar, Clarus Amicitia, Cor Leonis and Weskham Armaugh on their trip to Accordo. A reckless driver, he crashed the Regalia shortly after leaving the Crown City. He and his royal retinue stumbled upon an old gas station on the Leiden highway where Cid got the Regalia running again. Cid gave the hammer he used to Regis to serve as a cautionary reminder to handle the car with care. Regis ultimately returned it with an affectionate carving, signifying that he had honed his own mechanical skills to the point that he no longer needed assistance. </p>
          <p>During his travels Regis met Ezma Auburnbrie, the leader of the Hunters who protect outlanders, and promised her the threat behind the sealed doors in the dungeons of Lucis would be dealt with once the war with Niflheim was over. Regis traveled to Accordo to seek the restoration of an allied force where he was aided by Camelia Claustra, but was forced to withdraw to the Crown City due to the Lucian army's defeat. King Mors pulled the range of the Wall back to Insomnia's ramparts to maintain the strength to resist the empire's invasion efforts,[3] leaving many formerly-protected areas vulnerable to imperial aggression and various locales were decimated. At some point, Regis took in the orphaned Titus Drautos[4] who would become the leader of the Kingsglaive one day. Regis fell out with Cid who disagreed with the Crown's strict policy in allowing refugees into Insomnia, and never returned to the Crown City from their trip. </p>
          <p>Regis became the king of Lucis in M.E. 729 when Mors passed away.[5] Regis married his childhood friend, Aulea, in M.E. 732.[6] Two years later, Insomnia was attacked by a mysterious stranger wielding unique powers and aided by the God of Fire Ifrit. Regis led Lucis in repelling the attack, even confronting the stranger personally, coming to realize the enemy was the fabled Adagium. He was overpowered, but the Founder King's spirit, having heard the challenge of his brother, saved Regis and battled the Adagium. Although the Founder King was defeated, Bahamut saved Regis by defeating Ifrit and spiriting the mysterious attacker away. </p>
          <p>Two years later Regis and Aulea had a son, Noctis. When Regis heard Aulea was suddenly entering into labor, he and Cor dropped everything, and raced the Regalia to the hospital in such a manner they damaged the car. After Aulea passed away Regis became the sole parent to their infant son.[7]</p>
          <p>Regis had inherited the task of upholding the magical Wall that isolates Insomnia from the rest of Eos, but doing so drains his life-force and he thus ages rapidly. His seat of power is in Citadel, one of the most prominent buildings in Insomnia, where the Crystal is also kept. The Crystal is a magical artifact said to have been gifted to the Lucis Caelum line by the gods two thousand years ago. The kings are sworn to protect it until the coming of the prophesied King of Light, a person chosen by the Crystal from this bloodline to save the world from darkness. </p>
          <p>When Noctis was still young, Ignis became his retainer, and King Regis asked the young boy to always support his son. In M.E. 741 Regis learned from the spirits of the old kings that Noctis is the Chosen One. This led to Regis establishing the Kingsglaive as his personal guard, an elite group of soldiers from the outlands of Lucis who wield Regis's power.[8] When Noctis was still young, Regis regaled a tale of how he, Weskham, Clarus and Cid once went on an adventure and ran into a talking octopus. </p>
          <p>In M.E. 744, Regis traveled to Tenebrae with Noctis, who was to recuperate there from a serious injury. As depicted in Brotherhood Final Fantasy XV, their motorcade had been attacked by a marilith, and though Regis had saved Noctis the latter had fallen to a coma. Regis had stayed by his son's bedside and given him a Carbuncle totem as a charm that would protect him. As depicted in Platinum Demo – Final Fantasy XV, Carbuncle guided Noctis through a dream from which he would awaken after finding Regis's car, associating it with safety and being with his father. After Noctis's near-death experience, he became withdrawn, but befriended Princess Lunafreya of Tenebrae during his stay there. </p>
          <p>As depicted in Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, Niflheim attacked Tenebrae to kill Regis and Noctis. General Glauca and Regis had a brief standoff and Regis repelled his attack with the Sword of the Father. When Regis took Noctis and Lunafreya to flee, the young Prince Ravus of Tenebrae begged him for help. Regis could not listen to the boy's pleas and Lunafreya elected to stay behind with her older brother, forcing Regis to abandon her. Ravus would always blame Regis, but Lunafreya understood the king's actions. </p>
          <p>Regis returned to Insomnia where he grew frail from upholding the Wall, the only thing protecting the city from being invaded by Niflheim. Perhaps motivated by the knowledge of the dark future that lay before them, Regis wanted Noctis to live a regular childhood, and the prince attended a normal school, became best friends with a commoner, and even worked a regular part time job as a teenager. As depicted in Brotherhood, Regis tasked Ignis with looking after Noctis's needs as his advisor and friend. Noctis struggled seeing his father grow frail before his eyes, with knowledge he would need to succeed the throne. On Noctis's 16th birthday Regis gifted him the Engine Blade. </p>
          <p>As depicted in the Omen short film, at some point Regis spoke with a voice within the Crystal, who demanded one more life (perhaps Regis's). Regis witnessed an ominous premonition of Noctis's journey and being led astray by an evil entity. </p>
          <p>In M.E. 756, Regis is offered terms of peace by Ardyn Izunia, the chancellor of Niflheim. Forced to accept the proposed treaty as he feels he won't be able to maintain the Wall for much longer, Regis sends Noctis to Altissia to marry Lunafreya alongside his friends Ignis Scientia, Gladiolus Amicitia, and Prompto Argentum. As told in Final Fantasy XV Prologue Parting Ways, Regis is so busy with the treaty-signing preparations he doesn't have time to see Noctis when the latter comes to the Citadel. The day before Noctis is to depart, Regis spends all day in meetings. He speaks with Gladiolus's father, Clarus Amicitia, who is his bodyguard and sworn shield. Regis ponders how the future generations will remember him, and hopes Noctis will one day understand why he sent him away without telling him the truth; he knows the treaty to be a trap, but feels they are out of options. Expecting an attack, Regis has the Crownsguard—Insomnia's military force—on duty to protect the citizens and has the Crownsguard's usual duties taken over by the Kingsglaive. He addresses the apprehensive outlands on the deal by saying he has not forsaken them, but is signing the treaty to protect the people from war. </p>
          <p>As depicted in Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, Regis welcomes Emperor Aldercapt to Insomnia with a grand party. Regis remains suspicious of his guest and believes he intends to steal the Crown City's Crystal. Regis's fears are confirmed when Niflheim's magitek infantry attacks on the day of the treaty-signing. As Iedolas and Ardyn take the Crystal, the Wall falls and Niflheim deploys magitek weapons within Insomnia. Regis and the council members dispatch the soldiers sent at them, but end up confronting General Glauca. Clarus is killed, and Regis continues to duel Glauca alone. He is overpowered and the Ring of the Lucii is severed from his hand. However, the ring rejects those not of royal blood and it returns to his possession. A Kingsglaive soldier Nyx Ulric and Lunafreya come to Regis's aid, and with them, Regis escapes down a secret passageway. </p>
          <p>At the end of the passageway Regis gives the Ring of the Lucii to Lunafreya and asks her to pass it on to Noctis. He begs Nyx to take Lunafreya to Altissia. Regis stops amid their escape and barricades Lunafreya and Nyx with his magic, expressing his remorse for having failed her back when Tenebrae was attacked. Regis sacrifices himself to Glauca so that Lunafreya and Nyx can escape, briefly holding him at bay with his lightning magic before being overpowered and killed. </p>
          <p>Regis's spirit joins the rank of the Lucian kings inside the Ring of the Lucii. Regis argues in favor of Nyx among the Lucii when the latter puts on the ring despite not being of the royal bloodline. Regis convinces the kings to grant Nyx the power of the ring, albeit at the cost of Nyx's life at dawn. Nyx uses his gifted powers to kill Glauca while Lunafreya escapes the city with the Ring of the Lucii. Ravus (who has become the deputy high commander of Niflheim's army) takes Regis's sword from his body, keeping it on his person, prepared to yield it to Noctis should the latter prove he is the Chosen King. </p>
          <p>When Noctis hears of the events he tries to return, but finds Insomnia blockaded. He at first doesn't understand why his father hadn't told him the truth, but as urged by Cor sets out to collect the royal arms of his forbears and to forge covenants with the Astral gods of Eos. Cor explains to Noctis that the day Regis sent him on his journey, he hadn't wanted Noctis to remember him as the king, but just to be his father. Cor tells Noctis Regis always had faith that when the time came, Noctis would ascend for the sake of his people. </p>
          <p>Lunafreya delivers the Ring of the Lucii to Noctis just before her death. The Starscourge, a malady that infects men and beast alike to turn them into daemons and blots out the sun, advances without hindrance now that Lunafreya—the last Oracle—is gone. The world plunges into chaos and eternal night. Noctis learns of his destiny as the King of Light when he finds the stolen Crystal in the imperial capital. Ten years after King Regis's death, Noctis returns, having absorbed the Crystal's light, ready to fulfill his destiny. Donning King Regis's old attire, he meets with Cor Leonis in the Kingsglaive's base in Insomnia, who comments he looks just like his father, and explains Regis believed Noctis will save the world and that's why he chose to save him at the cost of everything else. He is glad to have served "two of the greatest kings Lucis ever had". </p>
          <p>Noctis has returned to the ruins of Insomnia to challenge Ardyn, the immortal embodiment of the forces of darkness. Regis's spirit is summoned from within the Ring of the Lucii to help Noctis bring an end to the Starscourge, a plague that has left Eos in perpetual darkness to be ruled by daemons. When Noctis and his friends reach the room in the Citadel with the paintings of the prophecy, he remarks he never liked it as a child because his father was always so somber there. Holding his father's sword, Noctis sits on the throne as Regis's spirit manifests before him. When the spirits of the past kings attack Noctis, Regis looks away until he is the only one left. Taking up his Lucii form, Regis delivers the final blow with his royal arm. As Noctis's soul is taken by the ring, he, alongside his father, Lunafreya, and the past kings of Lucis, delivers a finishing blow to Ardyn's corrupted spirit. His destiny fulfilled, the Ring of the Lucii breaks and the sun rises. </p>
          <p>Regis's voice declares Noctis and Lunafreya a man and wife as they share the Lucian throne, seated above a banner bearing the name Noctis Lucis Caelum CXIV. </p>
