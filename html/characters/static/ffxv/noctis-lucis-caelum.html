          <p>Noctis Lucis Caelum (ノクティス・ルシス・チェラム Nokutisu Rushisu Cheramu), "Noct" (ノクト Nokuto) for short, is a fictional character from Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. He is a playable character and main protagonist of Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII. The crown prince and protector of Lucis, Noctis and his allies must defend their country when the empire of Niflheim attacks Lucis in an attempt to take control of its magical Crystal. Alongside Final Fantasy XV, Noctis has appeared in the game's expanded media, including Final Fantasy crossover titles, and other game titles including Puzzle & Dragons and the fighting game Tekken 7. </p>
          <p>Noctis was created and co-designed by Tetsuya Nomura, with later design revisions being handled by Yusuke Naora. Nomura created Noctis as a type of protagonist not featured in a leading role in the Final Fantasy series before. He also wanted his personality to be unique in the series, being unlike protagonists like Squall Leonhart or Cloud Strife, instead focusing more on realism. Noctis' clothes were designed by Hiromu Takahara, lead designer for Japanese fashion house Roen. His clothing was created to be both asymmetric, mirroring the fashion house's trademark style, and indicative of the game's themes and atmosphere. Before his design was finalized, Noctis was given a story-inspired temporary outfit used in early trailers. </p>
          <p>Since his original reveal, Noctis has been compared with other asocial characters seen in the series' other games based on his appearance. Following the release of the game, Noctis has been positively received by journalists, with many noting his growth over the course of the story, and contrasting him against other Final Fantasy protagonists. His appearances in both the expanded media of Final Fantasy XV and other games have gathered multiple types of responses. </p>

          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Concept and Creation</h3>
          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p>Noctis was created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura, the original director of Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off titled Final Fantasy Versus XIII.[6][32] Nomura did not want Noctis to look strong, instead being used more to communicate the darkness in the story, which caused some difficulties for the team.[32] His full name loosely translates from Latin into "Light of [the] Night Sky";[33][34] his nickname, Noct, translates as "of the Night".[35] Noctis's name was not going to be based on the sky or weather, as with previous protagonists designed by Nomura. After Lightning, the main protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII, was given a weather-based name, Nomura gave Noctis his current name.[36] This name was also a reference to Sora, the main protagonist of the Kingdom Hearts series; Sora and Caelum both mean "sky" in their respective languages, and Nomura considered Noctis to be his latest "son".[34] Noctis' adult appearance was designed by art co-director Yusuke Naora.</p>
          <p>A major departure from Noctis' character in contrast to previous Japanese role-playing games' protagonists was his aging across Final Fantasy XV. Despite fears of how it would be received by fans, the Square Enix staff decided to make this change. Tabata further elaborated that it "felt that it was important in communicating [the party's] development and wanting to express it in a way that we only can with the current generation of consoles."[39] When creating the development of Noctis' facial features over time, the team drew from pictures of war veterans and actors to add finer details to help mature the character's expression. They also designed Noctis' features so they would hold similarities to Regis, reflecting the game's theme of the father-son relationship.[40]</p>
          <p>While the game changed names, platforms and eventually directors, Nomura worked with new director Hajime Tabata to ensure that Noctis remained as unchanged as possible in the final product.[41] Alterations and adjustments made to his character model were supervised by Naora. The main goal was to make Noctis appear more realistic: his skin texture was enhanced and subtleties added to its depiction and the effect of different lighting on it, in addition to adding elements such as subtle birthmarks and skin blotches. One of the major goals was keeping the same character impression while making adjustments and enhancements, as series fans already had a concept of who the character was. His hair's shadow effects needed to be adjusted after the upgrade in technology so they did not cast too much shade on his face, but the hairstyle itself was kept consistent.[38] His hairstyle was meant to give two impressions to the player: from the front it was ordered, while from the rear it looked wild.[36] In order to make his hair movements realistic, the team worked with a professional hairstylist to create the design using a mannequin's wig, then used the Luminous Studio engine to render it in real-time. The technique was originally used for the characters in the engine's 2012 tech demo Agni's Philosophy.[42]</p>
          <p>The character's clothing was designed by Hiromu Takahara, the main designer at Japanese fashion house Roen.[43] Takahara's key inspiration for the style and coloring of the clothing was "jet black", which was meant to exemplify and be representative of the game's atmosphere. In addition, Takahara designed the outfit along the same lines as the asymmetric designs common to Roen's clothing lines.[44] His outfit was designed to make Noctis look like someone who went to a high-class pub.[45] Unlike previous Final Fantasy protagonists, a real set of Noctis' clothes was created by Roen and kept in the office for reference by the development staff: this was due to previous experiences when Nomura had been constantly asked what materials his characters' outfits were made of by the graphics teams.[34] An aspect of his design central to the story was a ring he wore on his right hand, while the gloves he wore were simply for "design purposes".[44] Noctis's outfit when the game was first revealed was a temporary one used while his final look was being created.[36] It was based on the game's script to give a visual impression in trailers.[45] Takahara also designed a formal suit worn by the character in the original opening section of the game.[46] All Roen designs, including Noctis' suit, were retained when Versus XIII was rebranded as Final Fantasy XV as the team felt wrong about removing them despite the other changes.[47]</p>

          <hr/>
          <h2 class="text-center text-light">Story Ahead. Contains Spoilers.</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Noctis is the son of King Regis and Queen Aulea, the crown prince of Lucis and thus heir to the Caelum line. When Regis heard Aulea was suddenly entering into labor, he and Cor Leonis—the marshal of the Crownsguard and Regis's friend—dropped everything, and raced the Regalia to the hospital in such a manner they damaged the car. Regis was elated at Noctis's birth, but Aulea died when Noctis was still an infant.[9] Ignis Scientia became Noctis's retainer when he was three[10], and is thus his oldest friend. Two years later King Regis learned from the spirits of the old kings that his five-year-old son is the Chosen King prophesied to sacrifice himself to save the world.[11][8] Perhaps for this reason Regis wanted Noctis to live a full, normal life, and Noctis had a relatively usual childhood, such as being enrolled in a regular school. </p>
          <p>As depicted in Brotherhood Final Fantasy XV, when he was eight years old, Noctis was the victim of the daemon Marilith, implied to have been unleashed upon them by Niflheim, the empire that has been at war with Lucis for hundreds of years. The servants who accompanied him perished while Noctis was gravely injured, but he was saved by Regis and his attendees. As depicted in Platinum Demo – Final Fantasy XV, Noctis went into a coma and retreated into a dream world where he came under the protection of Carbuncle, a magical creature who helped him fend off attacks from an unknown force attempting to keep him from waking up. Afterward Noctis spent time in the country of Tenebrae recovering, where he befriended the young Princess Lunafreya: while their time together was short they bonded and she showed Noctis a red notebook they would come to use for secret correspondence, using her magical dog Umbra as a messenger. </p>
          <p>Noctis learned about the Crystal of Lucis and how his father is its sworn protector from Lunafreya, who explained he is the Crystal's chosen to banish the plague of darkness from the world. Noctis promised to do it, although he didn't understand what was asked of him. Noctis also met Gentiana, the mysterious High Messenger of the gods who stays by Lunafreya's side. Gentiana was pleased the future king of Lucis would have such a close relation to the Oracle. </p>
          <p>As depicted in Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, Niflheim invaded Tenebrae and Regis barely escaped with the young Noctis. Though he tried to also take Lunafreya, she opted to stay behind as she couldn't abandon her brother, Ravus. From that time on Noctis and Lunafreya could no longer see each other, although they kept in secret contact via Lunafreya's magical dogs. Noctis never fully recovered from the attack from Marilith. </p>
          <p>When a king of Lucis dies, their wisdom is passed to the next generation via the bonding of souls, and thus the royal line lives on. The family heirloom, the Ring of the Lucii, contains the accumulated powers of the previous kings and is inherited by the person next in line for the throne. However, using the ring's powers saps the user of their life force. Regis was doomed to age prematurely due to his life energy being needed to maintain the Wall around Insomnia, the Crown City. Regis is conflicted about whether to put such a burden on Noctis. </p>
          <p>As depicted in Brotherhood Final Fantasy XV, despite being royalty, Noctis attended a regular school where he met a boy named Prompto, whom Lunafreya had advised to seek Noctis's friendship as he hadn't mingled much with his peers. Gladiolus was his tutor for battle skills since early age, although the two did not initially get along, Gladiolus viewing him spoiled. The two befriended after a ten-year-old[10] Noctis saved Gladiolus's younger sister Iris from getting lost and took the blame for wandering outside the palace grounds even if he had only been following Iris to make sure she didn't get hurt. When Noctis was fifteen he moved to live alone to gain more independence and entered high school[10], and he and Prompto became friends. Although Noctis did well in his exams, graduating as top of his class, he struggled with the pressures of being the future king and the prospect of his father dying. To keep such pressures off his mind, he lived his youth like a general citizen for his age, including taking up a part time job at a sushi restaurant. </p>
          <p>At age 20 Noctis sets forth from his homeland to formalize the union of states through his marriage to Lady Lunafreya of the imperial province of Tenebrae. Accompanying Noctis are his friends—Ignis, his royal advisor; Gladiolus, his bodyguard; and Prompto, his best and only friend from high school. As depicted in Final Fantasy XV Prologue Parting Ways, Noctis tried to meet Regis the day before they left, but the king was too busy with the treaty-signing preparations. Lucis was to relinquish all territories outside Insomnia to the empire in exchange for peace. Regis knew it to be a trap, and didn't tell Noctis of the true reason he is being sent away from the city with his friends, hoping Noctis would one day understand his reasons. </p>
          <p>The four head toward Altissia so Noctis can marry Lunafreya to solidify relations between their countries as a political union. Regis sees them off with a heavy heart at the steps of the Citadel. On their way across Leide, Regalia, Regis's car the party is using, breaks down. The party pushes it to the nearest service station, Hammerhead, where they meet the mechanic Cindy and her grandfather Cid, Regis's old comrade. </p>
          <p>Cid recognizes Noctis and assures them the car can be fixed but it will take time, leaving the party stranded for the time being. Though knowing Noctis is the prince, Cid doesn't act respectfully, implying he doesn't think Noctis is ready to become the king. Cindy handles the repairs, and the party is left to make the money to pay her. Once the repairs are done, the party heads to the port town of Galdin Quay where they hope to take a ferry to Altissia. However, the ferry is not running. They meet a mysterious stranger who acts flippantly and gives them an Oracle Ascension Coin as "allowance." </p>
          <p>The party learns that Niflheim has attacked the Crown City, the Wall has fallen and the empire has stolen the Crystal. Noctis and his father are reported dead alongside Lunafreya. They turn back, but a blockade prevents them from reaching the city. They find a high vantage point to see it from a distance, and receive a call from Cor Leonis as to the state of affairs. Noctis learns that the news of the king being dead are true, and Cor helps him get started on his quest of retrieving the legendary weapons of Lucis's past rulers. After opening the road to Duscae, Cor deems Noctis strong enough to continue on his mission without his help, and departs. </p>
          <p>Iris calls Noctis to tell him she's made it to the town of Lestallum, and they decide to go see her. On the way there they have an option of visiting the Meteor of the Six said to have fallen to Eos eons ago, but if they try they are repelled by imperial forces. In Lestallum, Iris shows Noctis around the town and he learns Lunafreya made it out of Insomnia. With little recourse and Noctis's duty to his country, the party resumes its trip to Altissia in hopes that she headed there, however, the ferry is still out of commission. </p>
          <p>Noctis is tipped off on a royal tomb being hidden in the cavern behind a waterfall, and his party heads to retrieve it. Noctis begins to experience sudden headaches and bizarre visions as the Archaean Titan is calling for him. The Disc of Cauthess area where Titan resides, said to be holding the meteorite, is locked down by the empire, but Ardyn Izunia, the mysterious stranger they had met in Galdin Quay revealed to be the chancellor of Niflheim, opens the way for them. Noctis comes before the Astral as imperial forces storm in and try to destroy the god. Noctis has a vision of Lunafreya communing with Titan, and forms a covenant with him, gaining the ability to summon him. Surrounded by imperial forces, Ardyn helps Noctis's party escape the site. Though Ardyn has been helping them, Noctis does not trust him. </p>
          <p>Lunafreya is seeking to rouse the gods of Eos, known as the Six, who have been slumbering since the War of the Astrals and said to awaken only for the time of the prophecy. Noctis receives a message from her via Umbra, in which she lends her support to his cause. Duscae is shrouded in a storm until Noctis passes Ramuh's trial and gains the means to summon him. Noctis is guided by Gentiana who communicates with him telepathically, directing him what he needs to do to gain the gods' favor. </p>
          <p>Upon acquiring Ramuh's power, Noctis and his retinue infiltrate the nearby imperial base to recover the missing Regalia. After fighting through the magitek armors and soldiers at the base, Noctis is confronted by Ravus Nox Fleuret before he can reach the car. Ravus is Lunafreya's brother and now the high commander of Niflheim's army. Ravus berates Noctis for his obliviousness on the consequences of forming covenants with gods and is about to battle them, but Ardyn intervenes, withdraws the army and reminds Ravus he needs to head off to Altissia. With the Regalia recovered, the party returns to Lestallum. </p>
          <p>When they meet Iris back at the hotel, she reveals that the imperial general Caligo Ulldor attacked Lestallum and the Amicitia family chamberlain, Jared Hester, was killed defending Iris. His grandson Talcott is traumatized and Noctis expresses his sorrow for his loss. During the night, Noctis dreams of following Lunafreya's dog Pryna while encountering various terrors. </p>
          <p>Noctis and the party escort Iris to Cape Caem, but on their way discover the empire has set up yet another "flying fortress" near Old Lestallum. With Ignis's help, Noctis incapacitates General Caligo, but he escapes before they can exact revenge for the killing of Jared. As he leaves the base, Noctis is ambushed by Commodore Aranea Highwind, whom Caligo spoke of in distrust. After a brief fight she leaves. Noctis continues to Cape Caem, where the Hammerhead crew is busy working on Regis's old ship, which will grant them passage to Altissia. They stay at Iris and Talcott's new house by the sea, where Talcott reveals that there is still mythril ore that can be used to repair the ship at Vesperpool. </p>
          <p>Gladiolus goes off on his own to contemplate the recent events. Noctis, Ignis, and Prompto slip into the empire-held area with Ardyn's help although they cannot fathom why an imperial official is helping them. They venture to find the ore under the supervision of Aranea whom Ardyn "hired" to escort Noctis. She guides them through a submerged temple, an anomaly created by ancient magic of Solheim. Through her, Noctis learns that the bulk of the empire's military force is powered by daemons, creatures that lurk in the depths of caves and emerge during the darkest hours of the day. Aranea is concerned over the direction the regime is taking. After securing the mythril, Aranea wishes Noctis well, advising him to choose his own path in life. Noctis and his party return to Lestallum where Noctis teams up with a hunter to rid the local power plant of daemons who turns out to be Gladiolus. </p>
          <p>Noctis and his friends make their way to Altissia on King Regis's royal vessel. During the trip they discuss the news of Ravus being the high commander of the imperial army, and him holding King Regis's sword, although he cannot wield it as he is not of the Lucian line. Noctis feels ambivalent, but believes he'll be able to reclaim the sword from Ravus. </p>
          <p>While in Altissia, Noctis negotiates with the First Secretary Camelia Claustra to let Lunafreya rouse Leviathan, but doesn't get to see the latter, as she is being held for her safety. Lunafreya gives a speech to the masses about her desire to wake the Hydraean and to help banish the growing darkness. The world is plagued by a phenomenon known as the Starscourge that lengthens the nights, but the line of the Oracles—of which she is the latest—has the power to fight this darkness. Noctis undertakes Leviathan's trial, who goes berserk despite Lunafreya's efforts to calm her. Lunafreya calls upon the spirits of the past kings of Lucis to aid Noctis who battles Leviathan with the power of kings until Titan interferes and Leviathan is calmed. Amid Noctis's battle, Ardyn stabs Lunafreya and Noctis is powerless to help her. </p>
          <p>After the battle a weakened Noctis is left lying on the ruined Altar of the Tidemother. A mortally wounded Lunafreya crawls to Noctis and heals him. The two converse in a dreamlike realm, the prince sad he could not save her. She passes the Ring of the Lucii to him, which she had been holding for him as per King Regis's final request. While Noctis is unconscious, he unknowingly is threatened by Ardyn, but saved by Ignis who lends power from the Ring of the Lucii to fend him off at the cost of his eyesight. Noctis awakens days later to learn of Lunafreya's passing from a now blind Ignis. Ignis asks Noctis to reconsider their journey, but Noctis refuses to give up, saying that all the sacrifices made for him would be meaningless if he did not continue. </p>
          <p>Noctis and his team carry on to Gralea, the capital of Niflheim, to regain the Crystal the empire has stolen. They travel through the continent on train, and though now in possession of the ring of his ancestors, Noctis refuses to wield its power. This angers Gladiolus, who sees Noctis's struggle to deal with his grief as a sign he is not ready for the task upon them. After retrieving the Katana of the Warrior, another of the royal arms, Ignis speaks up to heal the rift that has formed between the companions, and Noctis remains determined to push on.</p>
          <p>Their train is attacked by imperial forces, and amid the chaos Noctis is tricked by Ardyn to push Prompto off the moving train and Noctis realizes Ardyn wields supernatural powers. They are unable to go back to him and assume Prompto has been captured by the empire. They stop at Tenebrae and find the Fenestala Manor aflame as revenge by the empire; Ravus is reported to have been executed for high treason for the Leviathan incident, and thus the bloodline of the Oracles has ended. Without Lunafreya holding back the darkness, sunlight has almost vanished from the world with ever more daemons spawning. As they speculate that the Crystal has the power to repel the daemons, Noctis is even more desperate to seek it out. Aranea has quit the imperial army and is now helping the victims of the empire's attacks with Biggs and Wedge. As the passage to imperial territory is dangerous, Noctis, Gladiolus and Ignis head to Gralea without the other passengers with Biggs and Wedge operating the train. While in Tenebrae, Noctis learns Ravus had always been on Lunafreya's side even though he had been affiliated with the empire. </p>
          <p>As they come into the territories outside the imperial capital, they find Ghorovas Rift covered in a blizzard. As daemons spawn to halt the train at Shiva's corpse. Noctis meets Ardyn again and demands to know what his gambit is, but the latter is frozen by Gentiana who reveals her true identity as the Astral goddess Shiva. Shiva tells Noctis the history of the Astrals and asks Noctis to set her love, god of fire Ifrit, free from being enthralled to the darkness. Shiva makes Lunafreya's love for Noctis known to him and Noctis forges a covenant with her, obtaining the Trident of the Oracle as a royal arm. Noctis vows that he and Luna will be together again, regretting he never had the chance to tell her how he feels. He learns Ardyn is immortal and all their attacks on him are ineffective. Pondering what Ardyn's true nature is, the party continues onward to Gralea with the knowledge that Prompto is held captive there along with the Crystal. </p>
          <p>Noctis, Ignis and Gladiolus enter Gralea by train but fall under attack and have to abandon the train with the belief that Biggs and Wedge can look after themselves. Noctis drives the Regalia into the city, but the car is destroyed and he becomes separated from his friends. He continues alone but finds he cannot summon his weapons to his side as his powers have been sealed. With Ardyn's taunting voice in his ears, Noctis decides to wield the Ring of the Lucii and blasts the daemons and magitek troops that spawn around him with magic. The imperial city is devoid of human life and swarming with daemons. The magitek troopers at the lab the Crystal is said to be kept in have gone rogue. Ardyn's disembodied voice keeps tormenting him as Noctis discovers the empire has been manufacturing daemons, that magitek troopers are made out of imperial experiments with clones, and that a "vanishing disease" has ravaged the imperial lands that has its citizens turn into daemons the empire cannot control. Noctis finds Ravus dead and recovers his father's sword. </p>
          <p>He is reunited with Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto. They discover Prompto was born at an imperial lab to be made an MT, and now doubts his friends would still accept him. Noctis doesn't skip a beat to welcome him back. As depicted in Episode Prompto, Noctis apologizes for having fallen into Ardyn's trap that led him to push Prompto off the train. Prompto forgives him, saying he also fell to Ardyn's manipulations. Noctis says that it doesn't matter where people are from, and that he would like to "break down borders" to remove all distinction between Niflheim or Lucian citizens. Prompto compliments that Noctis is speaking like a king. </p>
          <p>Prompto can open the way into Emperor Aldercapt's throne room. The emperor's robes are left on the seat as he has also vanished and become a daemon. After turning off the device that seals his powers, Noctis and his friends are ambushed by a daemonic Ravus who begs them to kill him. As more daemons keep appearing Noctis's friends urge him to go to the Crystal alone to use it to banish the daemons. </p>
          <p>Noctis reluctantly leaves his friends behind and makes it to the Crystal but is absorbed inside it while being taunted by Ardyn. Ardyn reveals his true name as Ardyn Lucis Caelum, Noctis's distant ancestor who worked healing the world from daemons two millennia ago. He had become corrupted by the plague he had absorbed and was rejected by the Crystal for his affinity with the darkness. The Crystal holds inside it the planet's soul and in this otherworldly dimension Noctis meets Bahamut and is made aware of his destiny as the True King. The True King is born once all of the Crystal's power is passed onto the Ring of the Lucii and Noctis can banish the darkness from the world at the cost of his own life. </p>
          <p>Noctis spends ten years in the Crystal accumulating its magic and strengthening himself to prepare for both his battle against Ardyn and his sacrifice. He awakens in the Angelgard island in a world of perpetual darkness. He meets Umbra who has a note for him saying that his friends will meet him in Hammerhead. As depicted in Final Fantasy XV: Comrades, Noctis is greeted by Libertus Ostium and other exhausted members of the Kingsglaive. Gentiana tells Noctis that he must go to Insomnia to end Ardyn. She tells him they will meet again, and he takes his father's boat to Galdin Quay, which is now abandoned and overrun by daemons. </p>
          <p>Noctis runs into Talcott, who drives him to Hammerhead and tells what happened in the last ten years. He meets with his old companions and they briefly catch up. They dress in their formal attire and set up camp for one final meal together during which Noctis struggles expressing all the emotions he is holding inside. </p>
          <p>They head to the ruins of Insomnia where countless daemons and automaton infantry await them. They find the Kingsglaive Base Camp underground and Noctis reunites with Cor Leonis and the remaining Glaives he now leads. After renewing the Glaives' hope for the future, Noctis and his retinue continue to the gates of the Citadel. Ardyn appears and sets the city ablaze with a meteorite shower and cloaks the Citadel in a daemonic Wall. Outside the gates to the Citadel the party defeats Cerberus, Ardyn's "guard dog", but cannot get past the Wall. </p>
          <p>As daemon hordes approach, Lunafreya's spirit summons the Astrals to break the Wall around the building. She implores Noctis to fulfill the prophecy, but disappears as Noctis touches her. Ardyn sends a daemonic Ifrit upon them, but Noctis defeats him with the other Astrals' help, fulfilling his promise to Shiva. As they ascend the tower, three Lucii in the thrall of the scourge attack them. Noctis's friends each take them down, and the Mystic, the Founder King of Lucis and Ardyn's brother, asks Noctis to free his brother from the darkness. Before heading to the throne room to fight Ardyn he asks to see the photos Prompto had taken of their journey, choosing one to take with him. </p>
          <p>Noctis finds Ardyn sitting on the throne below the Crystal and challenges him. Noctis kills Ardyn, who promises to wait him "on the other side". Noctis asks his friends to walk tall in a manner King Regis sent them on their journey ten years ago. Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto stay outside to fend off the daemons as Noctis ascends the throne. He calls the spirits of the kings of Lucis that attack him one by one, plunging the royal arms into Noctis's body until his soul is absorbed by the Ring of Lucii. Emerging in the realm between life and death,[8] Lunafreya's spirit reveals Ardyn's true form while the royal arms emerge from Noctis's body to be taken up by the Lucii to attack Ardyn. Noctis delivers a final blow, finally putting Ardyn's soul to rest. The prophecy is fulfilled and light is restored to Eos. </p>
          <p>Noctis sits on a throne dedicated to the 114th king of Lucis with Lunafreya in her wedding dress and the photo he took from Prompto. He rests his head, prepared to sleep. </p>
