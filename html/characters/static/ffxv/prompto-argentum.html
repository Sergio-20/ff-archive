          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Short Intro</h3>
          <p>Prompto Argentum (プロンプト・アージェンタム Puronputo Ājentamu) is a friend of Noctis from a lower-class family, dating back to their teenage years. On their journey, Prompto acts to lighten the atmosphere of the party, taking on burdens for others and lifting their spirits with his antics.[44][78] Initially a shy and obese child when he first met Noctis at school, a chance encounter with an injured Pryna prompts Lunafreya to ask him to be Noctis' friend—Prompto slims down and builds up his confidence, ending up firm friends with Noctis when they meet in high school.[82] During their journey to Niflheim, Ardyn tricks Noctis into knocking Prompto from the train, leading to his capture by Niflheim's forces.[74] Upon being found, Prompto reveals that he is actually from Niflheim, a baby designed to become a Magitek soldier but was spirited away to Lucis.[75] Prompto, along with Noctis' other companions, become Daemon Hunters until his return, and accompanies him to the final battle against Ardyn.</p>
          <p>A major element of Prompto's character is his humble origins when compared to Gladiolus and Ignis, expressing this in his words and actions.[83] Prompto's facial features and hairstyle underwent multiple redesigns, the more recent ones based on negative feedback from fans, so that he would have international appeal.[84] As with the rest of the party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family.[54] The character was initially unpopular with series fans, so the team designed Prompto's photography hobby—and its subsequent gameplay and story interactions—as a way of making him useful and enabling each player to chronicle their journey through the game.[30] Tabata later defined Prompto's camera as a manifestation of Prompto's wish to record Noctis and Lunafreya's journey.[83] Prompto proved to be the starting point for Brotherhood, as producer Akio Ofuji conceived the series based around wanting to expand upon a backstory created by staff surrounding his difficult childhood.[85] For Prompto's English performance, Inoue based him on the titular protagonist of Ferris Bueller's Day Off.[77]</p>

          <h2 class="text-center text-light">Story Ahead. Contains Spoilers.</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Prompto is a clone produced for military warfare by the Niflheim Empire. A codeprint is branded on his body as a form of identification that allows him and the other such subjects like him to gain access to certain secured facilities. His biological father is said to be Verstael Besithia, the leading magitek engineer in Niflheim, but in truth, Prompto is a clone of Verstael. Verstael wants to provide the empire with enough infants to make into a daemonified army, and thus uses his own genetic material to create them. When Prompto was a baby he was kidnapped from the First Magitek Production Facility by operatives working for the kingdom of Lucis, and brought to the Crown City. He was adopted by a common Lucian family when he was but one year old, from where he has his surname Argentum.[9]</p>
          <p>Prompto lived out his childhood in Insomnia, the Crown City isolated from the rest of Lucis by the Wall. The empire has a long-standing conflict with Lucis, and Prompto wears a wristband to hide the branded codeprint, being insecure of others questioning about it and discovering his true identity, although Prompto himself doesn't understand what the code means. </p>
          <p>As depicted in Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV, the 12-year-old[10] Prompto was a lone overweight boy who (seemingly) never saw his foster parents and had no friends. His only joy was to take photos and eat junk food. One day he encountered and treated a puppy with an injured leg, naming it "Tiny". The puppy returned to its home with Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, the former princess of Tenebrae. She noticed the name on the handkerchief Prompto had tied around the puppy's injured leg, and had her companion Gentiana investigate. </p>
          <p>Prompto received a letter from Lady Lunafreya expressing her thanks for taking care of her puppy, Pryna. Knowing he attended the same school as Prince Noctis for whom she had sent the dog, she requested that Prompto befriend him, since Noctis did not mingle much with his classmates. Prompto decided to approach Noctis, but stumbled. Noctis pulled him up, pointing out that he's "heavy", and left as the bell rang. The event motivated Prompto to lose weight before approaching Noctis again. </p>
          <p>Prompto started jogging and dieting, taking photos of himself to track his progress until he had shed the excess weight. During this period, Prompto would often sniff Luna's scented letter to motivate himself. With newfound confidence, a 15-year-old[10] Prompto approached Noctis in high school pretending they had never met before. Noctis, who recognized him, greeted him casually. </p>
          <p>At age 20, Prompto accompanies Noctis, Gladiolus and Ignis on their road trip across the land toward Altissia for Noctis to marry Luna, and Prompto is looking forward to finally meeting her. As depicted in Final Fantasy XV Prologue Parting Ways, Prompto comes to the Citadel the day before their scheduled departure to pick up his Crownsguard uniform, which he is to wear for the trip. He is nervous to be meeting the people in charge and affirms he has completed his self-defense training for the journey. He promises to protect Noctis, but is told to concentrate on self-defense. Prompto leaves the Citadel with Gladiolus, Noctis's bodyguard and part of their friend group. Prompto wants to show his parents his new clothes, considering it proof of being worthy to go on the trip. Prompto doesn't see them much ever since he was a kid, and when he gets home he finds his parents are not there. </p>
          <p>Night has fallen by the time Ignis, Prompto, and Gladiolus arrive to help Noctis clean his apartment. Noctis's remaining possessions are to be taken to the Citadel, including his comic book collection at which Prompto marvels at. They finish up by playing some King's Knight at Prompto's urging. </p>
          <p>Prompto is present when King Regis sees them off, amazed he was allowed at the palace. When the party's car breaks down, they push it to the Hammerhead service station for the mechanic Cindy Aurum to repair it. Prompto is instantly smitten with her. In Galdin Quay the party discovers the ferry to Altissia is not running and that the Crown City has been attacked, with King Regis, Noctis and Lunafreya all announced to have died. They turn back only to find the city blockaded. </p>
          <p>Cor Leonis, the Marshal of the Crownsguard, tasks Noctis with locating the royal arms of the past Lucian kings to gain the power to reclaim the kingdom. The empire is blocking the route to Duscae, and the party splits: Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto create a diversion near the Norduscaen Blockade, while Noctis and Cor defeat Loqi Tummelt, one of the imperial army's leading commanders. Cor departs, and Noctis's party heads to the city of Lestallum to meet up with Gladiolus's sister Iris. </p>
          <p>When the Archaean Titan begins calling for Noctis, they gain access to the Disc of Cauthess with help from Chancellor Ardyn Izunia of Niflheim, although they remain suspicious of his motives. Prompto and Ignis are left behind when Noctis and Gladiolus fall into the pit, but make their way to the pair in time to help battle Titan as Niflheim's forces attack it. Noctis gains Titan's allegiance and they escape with Ardyn's help, but later infiltrate an imperial base to reclaim their car when it is stolen. </p>
          <p>While searching for Ramuh, the entourage explores the Fociaugh Hollow, where a naga mistakes Prompto for her child, stealing away with him when he is separated from the group. Upon rescuing Prompto, the friends ponder why a daemon would think a human was their baby. </p>
          <p>They discover King Regis's royal vessel is kept in a secret harbor at Cape Caem. While collecting mythril for its repairs, Noctis, Ignis and Prompto join forces with Aranea Highwind, for whom Prompto again becomes attracted to. He wonders if Aranea will quit the army due to the empire's employment of daemons like she is considering. They reunite with Gladiolus at the EXINERIS power plant, who tells them how got his new scars. </p>
          <p>They take the boat to Altissia where Lunafreya is to awaken the Astral Leviathan. Prompto, Gladiolus and Ignis are to evacuate the city as Noctis prepares to forge his covenant with the sea goddess. Niflheim attacks Leviathan and Prompto rides a Niflheim magitek craft to take Noctis to the Astral. Noctis fights Leviathan alone, and though he gains her allegiance, he awakens couple days later to hear Lunafreya was killed and Ignis has lost his sight due to an injury. Prompto now usually stays by Ignis's side, helping him. </p>
          <p>En route to Tenebrae, Noctis spots "Ardyn" on their train and chases after him, not realizing it is Prompto transformed by an illusion. Prompto is confused by Noctis's sudden aggression toward him and tries to flee. Noctis soon defends the train from an imperial attack with who he thinks is Prompto, but in truth is Ardyn in Prompto's guise. Noctis is tricked into pushing Prompto off the train and into Niflheim's custody, realizing too late he had been caught in Ardyn's illusion. <p>
          <p>Several days later, as depicted in Episode Prompto, Prompto traverses the snowfields of Niflheim outlands alone. He succumbs to the cold and is found by magitek troopers and brought to a local magitek research facility. Ardyn returns Prompto his handgun and urges him to meet with his father, and tells him he was born here. Prompto is not ready to believe it, and sets out to escape the facility. </p>
          <p>He finds various firearms around the complex and uses them to destroy the MTs swarming the place. By reading the research notes and listening to audio logs from Verstael Besithia, the leading imperial magitek researcher, Prompto learns the empire produces MTs from daemonified human clones. As he finds dormant clones in their tubes, he finds they look like him, and have the same bar code tattooed on their wrists Prompto himself has. </p>
          <p>Prompto confronts Verstael who is turning into a daemon. Ardyn gloats this is a heartfelt father-son-reunion, but Prompto shoots the mutating Verstael, and Ardyn blames him for patricide. Aranea has infiltrated the magitek production facility as well to find the truth behind Verstael's magitek project. As she busts through the main room, she is surprised to find Prompto. She gets Prompto to his feet and gives him a snowmobile to escape the facility. Prompto rides until he is clear of imperial pursuit and camps out by a thawed lake. </p>
          <p>Aranea finds Prompto in the wilderness and joins him. Aranea urges him to return to his friends, but Prompto hesitates because of what he has learned. He doesn't think Noctis and the others would accept him, and thinks he is the very being Noctis seeks to eradicate from the world, and still having doubts whether Noctis had intended to eject him from the train. Aranea insists his origins don't matter, and that Prompto must decide what he wants out of life for himself, before leaving. </p>
          <p>The next day Prompto explores the wilderness alone. He finds magitek troopers lying in the snow, and shoots one. He finds himself empathizing with them, and imagines himself as another MT being hunted by Noctis, and sees the MT lying in the snow with his own face. He remembers being young and living in Lucis with a secret, always hiding the weird tattoo on him, never having friends. The illusions he witnesses while traveling the snowfield may have been created by Ardyn, but Pryna appears and guides Prompto to a field of fallen MTs. </p>
          <p>Prompto realizes what Aranea said about deciding his own path in life was true. He meets up with her again and wants to help her take down the monsters Verstael has been cooking up here in the remote arctic away from the emperor's gaze. Together they infiltrate another magitek facility and destroy Barbarus, Verstael's experiment to fuse magitek with a mammal. </p>
          <p>The Immortalis has been activated, a colossal magitek monster that now houses Verstael's soul. Aranea and Prompto flee the facility on a snowmobile that has a mounted machine gun. Aranea rides while Prompto uses the machine gun to destroy the magitek monstrosity that speaks to them in Verstael's voice about how it seeks to destroy the world with its newfound power. After defeating Immortalis, Prompto declares he is heading to Gralea to meet up with Noctis and the others so he can tell them the truth about himself. Unbeknownst to him, Ardyn is spying as Prompto parts ways with Aranea. </p>
          <p>At some point in his journey to reunite with his entourage, Prompto is recaptured by Ardyn and imprisoned in Zegnautus Keep in Gralea so the chancellor can lure and torment Noctis. Noctis's party saves Prompto and Noctis apologizes for having fallen into Ardyn's trap that led him to shove Prompto off the train. Prompto forgives him. He uses his codeprint to gain access to the Keep's throne room where the device sealing Noctis's powers is kept. Though Prompto struggles revealing his origins to the others, they readily accept him. </p>
          <p>After Noctis is absorbed inside the Crystal, the world plunges into perpetual darkness with roaming daemons. Prompto, Gladiolus and Ignis return to Lucis to wait for the prophesied day when the King of Light returns to banish the darkness from the world. Prompto begins training and spars with a member of the Kingsglaive. After being defeated, he leaves to train some more to later return for a rematch. Prompto often hangs around Cindy hoping to get her attention, but she is always busy with her work. Prompto matures to the point of hunting daemons alone, a stark contrast to how he used to always depend on his friends, and finds new purpose in helping out refugees. He hones his marksmanship to hit his targets in the dark and starts to dual-wield his guns as a rote maneuver in battle. </p>
          <p>After a ten-year slumber, Noctis returns and is reunited with his friends. Prompto is overjoyed to see his friend again, and they discuss the Kingsglaive and how some of them gave their lives to protect Noctis. Prompto's jovial and upbeat personality has not changed, causing Noctis to note he does not feel any different. After a final meal at camp, they head into the ruins of Insomnia to challenge Ardyn who has revealed his true identity as that Noctis immortal ancestor as an embodiment of the darkness. Though knowing Noctis must sacrifice himself to return the light to the world, Prompto tries to remain cheerful. </p>
          <p>The party returns to Insomnia, reunites with Cor Leonis and meets with the remnants of the Kingsglaive. At the Kingsglaive's base Noctis asks Prompto how things are going with "you know who" and Prompto replies that a gentleman doesn't kiss and tell, implying he has made some headway with Cindy. They fight the Cerberus and witness Lunafreya summon the Astrals to clear a path towards the Citadel. As they head to the throne room the group fights the Fierce, Rogue, and Mystic whose statues have been enslaved by the Starscourge. Prompto defeats the Rogue and reaffirms his promise to stand by Noctis's side. </p>
          <p>Noctis asks for one of the photos Prompto took during their journey to take with him. He asks his friends to "walk tall and take care of the rest". As Noctis goes off to offer up his soul, daemons emerge from the ground. Noctis's friends are with him in spirit when he erases Starscourge from the world by cleansing Ardyn's corrupted soul, and the sun finally rises. Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto survive, honoring their promise to Noctis. </p>
