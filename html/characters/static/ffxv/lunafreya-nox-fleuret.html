          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Short Intro</h3>
          <p>Lunafreya Nox Fleuret (ルナフレーナ・ノックス・フルーレ Runafurēna Nokkusu Furūre, Lunafrena Nox Fleuret), "Luna" (ルーナ Rūna) for short, is the main heroine of Final Fantasy XV and Kingsglaive, and one of the central figures in Noctis' journey.[11][56] A princess of the royal family of Tenebrae, Lunafreya forms an early connection with Noctis when her mother, Queen Sylva, cures him of a Starscourge infection.[11] During Noctis' stay, Lunafreya tells him of his role as the True King who will save Eos, and her future role as Oracle acting in support of him.[57] Following the death of Sylva during Niflheim's attempted assassination of Regis and Noctis, Lunafreya becomes the youngest Oracle in history, her position granting limited autonomy to Tenebrae.[11][46] During the events of Kingsglaive, Lunafreya unsuccessfully attempts to reach Noctis and Regis, then becomes central to Niflheim's infiltration and eventual invasion of Lucis's capital Insomnia. Lunafreya escapes with the Ring of the Lucii as both Regis and Kingsglaive member Nyx Ulric sacrifice themselves to ensure her safe escape.[51] Lunafreya then travels ahead of Noctis, waking the Astrals and preparing Noctis' covenants with them while guiding him through her companion Gentiana.[57][58] After successfully awakening the Astral Leviathan, she is fatally stabbed by Ardyn, managing to give the Ring of the Lucii to Noctis before dying.[59] It is later revealed that her covenants with the Astrals were slowly killing her, and she had been counting on her brother Ravus to finish what she started.[60] Lunafreya continues to support Noctis in spirit form, aiding him directly in his final confrontation with Ardyn in the afterlife. She then reunites with Noctis.[52][60]</p>
          <p>Lunafreya's place in XV was originally held by the similarly-named Stella Nox Fleuret (ステラ・ノックス・フルーレ Sutera Nokkusu Furūre), the main female protagonist of Versus XIII.[21] The relationship between Stella and Noctis was originally designed to be platonic rather than romantic, as Nomura felt a preference towards portraying a different kind of relationship between male and female protagonists. He also wanted to make her the first female character to "stand out from all previous [Final Fantasy heroines]".[61] A key scene for Stella was the meeting and conversation with Noctis during the game's opening.[62] While Nomura deliberately designed her against his usual tastes, he grew fond of her design over the years. Stella's design underwent alterations between 2011 and 2013, mainly to make her more beautiful.[28] She was intended to be a very polite person, with that politeness conveyed through specific dialogue traits in her speech.[63] During the transition from Versus XIII to XV, the developers envisioned a different type of heroine which did not fit with Stella's original role, but Stella was already known to and expected by fans who had followed the game's development.[30] Stella was initially redesigned to play a more active role in the story, but Tabata was uncomfortable about this.[64] Faced with the scenario of fans being disappointed if Stella's personality or role were changed, the developers instead opted to replace her entirely.[30]</p>
          <p>Stella's replacement Lunafreya was conceived by Tabata; he wanted a heroine who would properly portray the darker and more somber elements of the rewritten story of Final Fantasy XV.[64] Lunafreya was described as the "keystone" linking the narratives of Final Fantasy XV, Kingsglaive and Brotherhood.[56] While she did not have an active role in Kingsglaive, her character strength was conveyed through a single-minded determination.[65] During the design process, it was decided that Lunafreya would assume and accept responsibility from a young age, putting her in direct contrast with Noctis; this required Lunafreya to be older than Noctis, which influenced elements of her character design.[66] According to Tabata, the relationship between Noctis and Lunafreya was not a typical love story despite their being engaged.[67] He also defined Lunafreya's personality as being stronger than either Stella or Noctis.[68] Lunafreya was designed by Naora.[69] Her appearance was defined by Tabata as "strong and heroic", which would be conveyed by her expressions and actions.[66] Lunafreya was designed to give off the look of a strong-willed woman. To achieve this, the designers focused on the shape of her eyes and mouth, blending her appearance in Final Fantasy XV with that in Kingsglaive so she could project an air of grace and strength even when standing still. Her expressions reflected a notably wide range of emotions born from her goals, which resulted in her expression being "serious and somewhat sad".[66] To convey Lunafreya's strong will and her high-born status through her appearance, Naora consulted a professional hairstylist and makeup artist; the way makeup was applied to her eyes and mouth was changed accordingly, and her hairstyle was done to resemble "something that would require the assistance of a handmaiden". Care was taken not to make her too prim, so that players could relate more to her.[69]</p>

          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Childhood</h3>
          <p>Lunafreya and her older brother Ravus were once royalty of Tenebrae and were close allies with the royal family of Lucis. When she was born, Lunafreya was met by the High Messenger of the Astrals, Gentiana, who in time would tell her she is ordained to work with Prince Noctis of Lucis to bring light back to the world. Lunafreya and Noctis are childhood friends, and the memories they share are cherished by both. The two spent time together following Noctis's near-death experience with a marilith, when a twelve-year-old Lunafreya kept him company while he was recuperating. During his stay Noctis referred to her as "Luna," and the abbreviation stuck. </p>
          <p>During this time, she told Noctis about the Crystal of Lucis and how his lineage had been chosen by the gods to expel the plague of darkness from the world. Though the eight-year-old Noctis did not understand what it meant, he promised her he would do it. She showed Noctis her red notebook and the pressed sylleblossom within, telling Noctis the flowers are used to weave the royal family's crowns. The two would continue to keep in secret contact via her dog, Umbra, that acts as a magical Messenger. </p>
          <p>Niflheim invaded Tenebrae and killed many officials of the royal family, including Lunafreya's mother, Queen Sylva, who was also the Oracle. While fleeing from Niflheim forces with Regis and Noctis, Lunafreya chose to stay behind to be with her brother and Tenebrae was surrendered to Niflheim's control. She was held in captivity, so it is implied she had a rough childhood. As the sole remaining descendants of House Fleuret, Lunafreya and Ravus remain leaders of their homeland, now an imperial protectorate. When she was thirteen she entered into a covenant with Shiva, Gentiana's true form.[5] This was the year Shiva awoke as a giantess and attacked Niflheim before being subjugated by the imperial magitek army. </p>
          <p>As told in Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV, a 16-year-old Lunafreya's pet dog Pryna went missing while covertly visiting Noctis in Insomnia. When she returned, she had a handkerchief around her injured leg that read "Prompto". Gentiana suggested they find out Prompto's identity. Lunafreya sent Prompto a letter thanking him for saving Pryna and for being a friend to Noctis, prompting Prompto to self-improve and to befriend the prince.</p>
          <p>When Lunafreya was sixteen, she became the youngest Oracle in history under supervision from the empire,[6] and began to travel the lands to heal people with her powers. </p>

        <div class="container text-light">
          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">The treaty-signing</h3>
          <p>Twelve years after the invasion of Tenebrae, the Niflheim Empire offers peace terms to Lucis; as part of these terms Lunafreya is to be betrothed to Noctis. The terms are accepted and the wedding is planned to be held in Altissia. She publicly supports the peace treaty in a radio broadcast, and promises that her marriage will not hinder her duties as the Oracle even though her travels will be temporarily suspended until the wedding. </p>
          <p>As depicted in Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, King Regis sends one of his Kingsglaive, Crowe Altius, to bring Lunafreya to Altissia. The plan goes awry when Lunafreya is caught leaving by Ravus and a squad of magitek soldiers, and they force her to return to her room. Emperor Iedolas Aldercapt brings Lunafreya with him to Insomnia, the Crown City of Lucis, and she is escorted to the Citadel by Nyx Ulric, a member of the Kingsglaive. </p>
          <p>Lunafreya greets Regis warmly, though Noctis and his friends have already departed to Altissia. At the party in Caelum Via before the signing, she learns from Nyx that the Kingsglaive soldier sent to escort her was killed. She expresses remorse and receives a hairpin from Nyx that had been intended for Crowe to give to her. Later that night she is confronted by General Glauca, who asks her if she really thought that the peace treaty was real. </p>
          <p>Glauca imprisons her on a fleet of airships outside the borders of Insomnia. The Kingsglaive arrive to rescue her, but Lunafreya's kidnapping was a trap for them; many of their body are traitors. Nyx escorts her to safety on a hijacked airship after escaping Ultros, a daemon unleashed upon them. The imperials steal the sacred Crystal, and Lunafreya insists on returning to the Citadel against Nyx's advise to escape. Resolved to reach King Regis, she leaps off the airship and is caught by Nyx who reluctantly follows her. </p>
          <p>The two arrive at the throne room to find Regis in combat with Glauca. Glauca removes the Ring of the Lucii from Regis and Ravus, who had remained behind to take his revenge on Regis, puts it on. The ring is a Lucian royal heirloom that contains the collective powers and wisdom of each Lucian monarch and grants its immense power only to those it deems worthy. Ravus is burned when the ring rejects him. Nyx, Lunafreya, and Regis escape, and Regis gives the ring to her to pass on to Noctis. Regis erects a magical barrier between them despite her pleas to not leave them. Regis requests Nyx to protect her and the two watch on helplessly as Glauca kills Regis. </p>
          <p>Nyx and Lunafreya flee while being pursued by Niflheim forces. Nyx discovers he can no longer use magic as the result of the king's death, and soon realizes that Niflheim is using Lunafreya's hairpin to track their whereabouts. She picks up the tracer Nyx drops and tosses it into a machine that explodes. </p>
          <p>The two arrive at a rendezvous point with plans to meet with the Kingsglaive leader, Titus Drautos. They are accosted by one of the traitorous Kingsglaive, Luche Lazarus. She reluctantly tricks Lazarus into putting on the ring to gain its power, and takes it back from his burning corpse. Drautos arrives, but another former Kingsglaive member, Libertus Ostium, rams him with a car, forcing Drautos to reveal himself as Glauca. To fend off the powerful imperial commander, Lunafreya readies to put on the ring until Nyx stops her and puts it on himself. </p>
          <p>After being deemed worthy to wield the ring by the past kings of Lucis, Nyx orders Libertus to get Lunafreya out of the city. The Ring of the Lucii returns to her care after Nyx receives its powers. Nyx remains behind to battle Glauca while Libertus escapes with Lunafreya. They part ways on the outskirts and Lunafreya blends in with the refugees, meeting Gentiana and her dogs outside the city. </p>

        <div class="container text-light">
          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">To awaken the six</h3>
          <p>En route to his destination, Noctis is shocked to learn that Insomnia has fallen and that his father and his betrothed are believed dead. In truth, she escaped Niflheim's conquest of Lucis, and lets Noctis know she is fine via a message delivered by Umbra. She appears in Noctis's visions when he confronts the Astrals, the gods of Eos, also referred to as the Six. Noctis learns that she is rousing the Six, speaking to the Astrals on his behalf so that he can forge covenants with them and gain their power. </p>
          <p>Ravus becomes the high commander of the Niflheim army after Glauca's death. He is ordered to hunt down his sister, but ignores the orders. Instead, he helps Lunafreya escape Lucis back to Tenebrae. Ravus disagrees with her mission to help Noctis reclaim his throne, not believing Noctis is worthy of her sacrifice, as communing with the gods is making her ill. He talks with her on her field of sylleblossoms, imploring her to stop sacrificing herself for Noctis, whom he believes will not be able to fulfill the prophecy as the King of Light. She asserts that it is ordained that Noctis is the Chosen King, and that Ravus of all people should know this as he was personally judged by the Lucian kings of old and rejected. Ravus accuses her of throwing her life away, but Lunafreya asserts it is her choice. </p>
          <p>Lunafreya is sad the carefree days of their childhood are over, and all she sees ahead of them is more darkness. She is heartbroken she can't share her life with Noctis like they had dreamed, but Gentiana comforts her and promises to make her feelings known to Noctis in time. </p>
          <p>She makes her way to Altissia where the sea goddess Leviathan resides. She is sheltered by the local government, although Niflheim wants them to release Lunafreya to them. Ravus is in Altissia as well, and when they meet she asks him to take the ring to Noctis, but he tells her it is her mission. When she informs him that her flesh is failing her, Ravus insists that she must fulfill her calling and that, although she may no longer have the strength to complete her duty, she has the willpower to find the strength. He encloses the ring in her hand and comforts her. </p>
          <p>Altissia is where Lunafreya and Noctis were supposed to have gotten married, and her wedding dress is on display as a memorial to her. Noctis makes his way to Altissia and negotiates with the first secretary for Altissia to let Lunafreya perform the ritual to rouse the Leviathan. He succeeds, and though Niflheim soldiers approach her as she receives the Trident of the Oracle, she brushes their weapons aside and makes a public appearance to address the masses. She gives a speech where she explains that the world is being encroached by darkness, and that she will perform a rite of summoning. Noctis is among the crowd and is moved by her speech. </p>
          <p>The empire attacks and disrupts the summoning. Lunafreya beckons to Leviathan, but her words do not reach the angered Astral. Noctis is caught amid the chaos as Chancellor Ardyn Izunia of Niflheim appears and wounds Lunafreya, knowing Noctis would witness it. As she grips to Ardyn's arm, her healing powers activate, as he is tainted by the powers of darkness. He casts her aside and departs. To halt Leviathan's rampage, she summons the power of the kings of old to aid Noctis via the Oracles' trident, really one of the thirteen royal arms. Noctis fights Leviathan with the power of kings and wounds her. When the Astral god Titan appears to oppose Leviathan, Lunafreya shields an unconscious Noctis from the tidal wave. </p>
          <p>She speaks to Noctis in a dream world where she gives him the Ring of the Lucii. She is consumed by the Astral energy around them, but she promises to always watch over Noctis. Ravus and Ignis find the dying Lunafreya and unconscious Noctis on the Altar of the Tidemother. As her life fades, Ravus flies into a rage but is quelled by Ignis. Ravus laments how the only thing he wanted was for her to be happy and free to live a life of her own choosing, but knows her spirit will not rest until the prophecy has been fulfilled. Her body disperses into light, and her spirit appears to Ravus who begs her not to leave, but she vanishes. </p>
          <p>The world proclaims her to be dead, unable to find her body. When Noctis awakens days later, he learns she has died but that she had left him a message in the notebook. On the last page he finds a pressed sylleblossom. Noctis continues his journey to the imperial heartland to salvage the Crystal whose light he believes will save the world. When the train passes Shiva's corpse, Gentiana reveals her true identity as the Glacean to him. She bequeaths the Trident of the Oracle to him and delivers Lunafreya's feelings to him as she had promised. Noctis learns how much she had loved him and experiences a ghostly vision of her that disappears as he reaches out to her. </p>

        <div class="container text-light">
          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">The finale</h3>
          <p>When Noctis returns to Insomnia after his ten-year slumber, Lunafreya appears to him, and summons the Astrals to dispel the daemonic Wall Ardyn has erected over the Citadel. As she touches Noctis she disappears.
            Noctis fulfills the prophecy as Lunafreya had seen and banishes darkness from the world at the cost of his own life. When Noctis's spirit confronts Ardyn in the realm beyond, her spirit briefly aids Noctis as he and the spirits of the past Lucian kings prepare to deliver the final blow. Wearing her wedding dress, she appears with Noctis at the Lucian throne. King Regis congratulates the two after thanking Lunafreya for her efforts and declares them man and wife. After looking at the photo given to her by Noctis, Lunafreya kisses him and closes her eyes, preparing to sleep alongside Noctis. </p>
