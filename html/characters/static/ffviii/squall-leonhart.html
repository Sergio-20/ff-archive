          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p class="text-left">Squall Leonhart (Japanese: スコール・レオンハート Hepburn: Sukōru Reonhāto) is a fictional character and the primary protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII, a role-playing video game by Square (now Square Enix). In Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is a 17-year-old student at Balamb Garden, a prestigious military academy for elite mercenaries (known as "SeeDs"). He stands 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. As the story progresses, Squall befriends Quistis Trepe, Zell Dincht, Selphie Tilmitt, and Irvine Kinneas, and falls in love with Rinoa Heartilly. These relationships, combined with the game's plot, gradually change him from a loner to an open, caring person. Squall has appeared in several other games, including Chocobo Racing, Itadaki Street Special, and the Kingdom Hearts series, as Leon (レオン Reon). </p>
          <p>Squall was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modeled after late actor River Phoenix. Squall's weapon, the gunblade, also made so that it would be difficult to master. In order to make players understand Squall's silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character's thoughts open to them. Squall's first voiced appearance was in the first Kingdom Hearts game, voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for all other English-speaking appearances. </p>
          <p>Squall had a varied reaction from critics, with some judging him poorly compared to other Final Fantasy heroes due to his coldness and angst, and others praising his character development. Nevertheless, the character has been popular, and his relationship with Rinoa resulted in praise. </p>

        <div class="container text-light">
          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Concept and Design</h3>
          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p>The first character Nomura designed for Final Fantasy VIII, Squall was inspired by actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said that "[n]obody understood it."[3] Squall is 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall,[4] initially with longer hair and a more feminine appearance. After objections by game director Yoshinori Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine. He added the scar across Squall's brow and the bridge of his nose impulsively (to make the character more recognizable), leaving the description of its origin up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima.[5] Squall's first illustration was used as a set up to create the world around him. The logo of the game which had Squall embracing Rinoa was left as an open interpretation for fans who still had not played the game. The scar in Squall's forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was important for him.[6]</p>
          <p>Nomura's design of Squall included fur lining along his jacket collar as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers.[7] In Final Fantasy VIII Nojima worked to give players insight into what Squall was thinking, in contrast to Final Fantasy VII (which encouraged players to speculate).[8] In retrospective, Nojima believes the staff made him particularly "cool".[9] Across the video game it is implied that the character of Laguna Loire is Squall's father. However, Square Enix never confirmed it.[10] Nomura designed Squall to contrast with Laguna.[5]</p>
          <p>Nomura created Squall's gunblade with silver accessories.[11] The weapon is a sword with components of a revolver, sending vibrations through the blade when triggered;[12] this inflicts additional damage if the player presses the R1 trigger on the controller as Squall strikes an enemy.[12] Although the weapon was intended as a novel way for players to control weapons in battle, Nomura said he feels (in retrospect) that it looks odd.[5] Additionally, he felt it was very difficult to master.[6] Square's Hiroki Chiba said that his favorite moment in the Final Fantasy franchise was when Squall and Rinoa embrace in space due to the use of Faye Wong's "Eyes On Me" music in the background and having to work every frame to make it work.[13]</p>
          <p>During one of the cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by the Edea in battle. This created a theory that Squall dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it interesting if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.[14]</p>
          <p>While Final Fantasy VIII did not use voice acting, Squall obtained a voice in the Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts, where he is known as "Leon". There, he is voiced by David Boreanaz in the English version of the game and Hideo Ishikawa in the Japanese version. He returns in Kingdom Hearts II, voiced in the English version by Doug Erholtz. Erholtz said in an interview that he had a "fun journey" voicing Leon and it was a "really fun role to play".[15]</p>

          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Story</h3>
          <hr/>
          <h2 class="text-center text-light">Story Ahead. Contains Spoilers.</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Squall was born to Raine Loire in the village of Winhill, but she died shortly after his birth. Her husband, Laguna, never knew Raine was pregnant as he was in Esthar saving his and Raine's adopted daughter, Ellone, from Sorceress Adel's clutches. Both Squall and Ellone, whom Laguna had sent back to Winhill ahead of him, were sent to Edea's Orphanage on the Centra continent. </p>
          <p>Squall grew up in the orphanage and, despite the presence of other kids his age, Ellone was his closest friend whom he referred to as "Big Sis" although it is unknown whether he knew about their familial bond. Due to Ellone's unique ability to send a person's consciousness back in time, she was in danger from those who would want to exploit her and was moved away from the orphanage. No one told Squall why Ellone left and he assumed she had abandoned him. As a result, Squall developed a defense mechanism that eventually made him an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy who wished to go through life without dependencies. </p>
          <p>One day, during one of Squall's attempts to find Ellone, a dying sorceress and a teenage Squall appeared from the future. The sorceress passed on her sorceress power to Edea Kramer, the owner of the orphanage who was a sorceress herself, and passed away. The teenage Squall told Edea he was a SeeD from Garden and that the notions were originally her idea. Edea told the teenage Squall he is in the wrong time and he disappeared back into the time portal. </p>
          <p>Edea presumed that one day the orphan child Squall would grow up to become a SeeD and kill an evil sorceress. Thus Edea and her husband, Cid Kramer, started the SeeD organization as an anti-sorceress force. As Edea is a sorceress herself, Cid and Edea decided they can no longer stay together, and Edea went into hiding with the orphans who were not admitted to the Garden or adopted. </p>
          <p>As Squall himself theorizes, he was never adopted due to his already difficult personality, so sometime around the age of six Squall was admitted into the newly constructed Balamb Garden to train as a SeeD. He chose to train with the gunblade, a difficult weapon to master that takes years of training. He found a rival in Seifer who mirrored him in many ways, including the use of a gunblade and a remarkable aptitude for combat. </p>
          <p>Eleven years later Squall is known as a "lone wolf" among his peers. His superiors, such as his teacher Quistis Trepe, regard him as difficult to deal with, but respect his talents. The rivalry between him and Seifer has become common knowledge among the Balamb students. Due to Squall's use of Guardian Forces his memory has weakened, remembering only the feelings of abandonment he felt when Ellone left, but no longer remembering Ellone herself. </p>
          <p>In the morning of his field exam Squall duels Seifer and they scar each other's faces. While recuperating in the infirmary Ellone, who has come to the Garden from the White SeeD Ship to inform Cid of Edea's disappearance, happens upon him and recognizes him, but leaves before giving Squall the chance to get a closer look at her. Quistis accompanies him to the Fire Cavern where he obtains a new Guardian Force, Ifrit, and afterward they depart for the field exam in the Siege of Dollet. Squall is assigned to Seifer's squad who abandons the team and defies direct orders, leaving Squall to lead his team mates as they evacuate while escaping the X-ATM092 robot. After returning to the Garden Squall graduates along with Selphie, Zell and Nida. </p>
          <p>During the inauguration ball Squall meets Rinoa Heartilly who forces him to dance with her. Quistis orders Squall to accompany her to the training center where she reveals she has been dismissed from her position as instructor and seeks his emotional support, but Squall rebuffs her. They run into Ellone being attacked by a Granaldo who calls out to them. Squall and Quistis save her, but she is led away by two White SeeDs before she has a chance to explain herself, leaving Squall pondering how she knows him. </p>
          <p>Squall, Selphie and Zell are assigned a mission in Timber and during the train ride the trio falls asleep and dreams of the adventures of Laguna Loire and his friends from the past. Squall learns Rinoa is his first employer, and they are to assist the Forest Owls, freedom fighters devoted to freeing Timber from Galbadian control. Squall and his friends' first mission with the Forest Owls fails when, in an attempt to kidnap the Galbadian President Vinzer Deling, they end up capturing a body double posing as him instead. </p>
          <p>Displeased with the Owls' level of professionalism Squall asks to see the terms of employment the SeeD group is under and discovers they are under the Timber Owls' employment until Timber gains independence. Far from satisfied, the group nonetheless follows with the Forest Owls' plans to intercept the president's Timber-based television broadcast. Rinoa lets slip her views of the way SeeD live, and Squall remarks about her group's incompetence in turn. After the two exchange words, Rinoa abandons the plan and leaves. </p>
          <p>Seifer, with Quistis in hot pursuit, takes the president hostage over the air. Under Quistis's request Squall, Zell and Selphie rush to the studio to find Seifer backing away with the president into another room. The president's new ally, whom he was meant to announce on live TV, a sorceress, spirits Seifer away. </p>
          <p>With the Forest Owls' base destroyed, Squall and the others lie low for a while. Contemplating Seifer's fate leads Squall and Rinoa into argument over their views on life before they are given word it is clear to leave town. As returning to Balamb Garden is made impossible due to the train services having halted, they head to the nearest Garden, Galbadia Garden, taking Rinoa with them. On their way Rinoa and Squall argue over his cold attitude towards his team mates when he fails to support Zell who despairs over Balamb Garden's safety in lieu of Seifer's attack on the president. During the argument Squall passes out, experiencing another mysterious dream with Laguna. When he awakens, Rinoa apologizes. </p>
          <p>In Galbadia Garden the group learns of Seifer's supposed execution and Rinoa reveals he is her ex-boyfriend. The team receives new orders to assassinate the sorceress during her inauguration ceremony as the ambassador of Galbadia. A Galbadian student, Irvine Kinneas, is assigned to help them. With Squall as their leader the group makes their way to Deling City to meet with their contact, General Caraway, and run amid a father-daughter feud between Caraway and Rinoa. </p>
          <p>As the ceremony begins Sorceress Edea kills the president and claims Galbadia as her own and Squall discovers a renegade Seifer, rather than been executed, has become Edea's sorceress' knight. After Squall and Irvine save Rinoa from a pair of Iguions, Irvine chokes when he is signaled to shoot Edea. Squall reasons with him, and Irvine fires, but she deflects the bullet. Squall faces Seifer and Edea head on but she pierces Squall's right shoulder with an ice javelin rendering him unconscious, and the teams are arrested. </p>
          <p>After another Laguna dream Squall wakes up to find himself imprisoned. He is tortured by Seifer in the D-District Prison and during the interrogation Squall learns Edea has ordered a missile strike against both Balamb and Trabia Gardens. The group escapes and splits in two: The team led by Squall heads to warn Balamb Garden of the missile strike, and the other, led by Selphie, aims to sabotage the Missile Base and stop the launch. </p>
          <p>As Squall arrives he finds the Garden in chaos as a faction with allegiance to Garden Master NORG, Balamb Garden's financier, has staged a revolt against Headmaster Cid. Squall searches for the headmaster to warn him of the missiles, finding him bunkered in his office. Cid reveals the Garden's past status as a mobile bunker of Centra make and, upon activating the ancient system, the Garden transforms into a mobile fortress and avoids destruction by moving away from the spot the missiles were programmed to target. </p>
          <p>Squall's team is called to the basement level where they meet NORG himself. NORG wants to give up those associated with the assassination attempt to Edea to quell her wrath and save the Garden, but Squall and his friends defeat him. During the confrontation, NORG reveals Sorceress Edea and Headmaster Cid are married. Squall talks with Cid who admits this is the truth, and explains the SeeD's true purpose was always to fight a sorceress. </p>
          <p>The seaborne Garden is left adrift in the ocean currents and is met by the White SeeD Ship whose crew requests they hand Ellone (who is still hiding in the Garden) over into their protection. Squall remembers a young Ellone from one of his dreams, and finds she is the same girl he met in the infirmary and whom he saved from a Granaldo. Ellone reveals she has been sending Squall's consciousness back in time to inhabit Laguna, although she doesn't tell him why. Ellone departs with the White SeeD, leaving a confused Squall behind. </p>
          <p>When the Garden crashes into Fishermans Horizon due to a broken steering device, Squall and his group enact a formal apology. Mayor Dobe, the leader of the pacifist city, asks them to leave as their presence can only cause destruction. Galbadia invades the town and Dobe heads off to discuss peacefully with the soldiers. They do not listen and Squall fights the soldiers to save Dobe's life, being reunited with the Missile Base team of which they had no word until then. In a rare display Squall is happy they are alive and well, something Rinoa does not fail to notice. Dobe grudgingly accepts the team's apology, and orders the city's technicians to restore Balamb Garden to full functionality. </p>
          <p>Cid presents his resignation appointing Squall as the Garden's commander, a decision Squall is not at all pleased with. To show him their support Selphie and Irvine organize a concert in Squall's honor, and Rinoa has an eventful chat with him, encouraging him to trust in them as they trust in him. After the Garden is fixed Squall sets course to the town of Balamb only to discover it is occupied by the G-Army. Squall and his team free the town after defeating Fujin and Raijin, Seifer's friends who now work for him. </p>
          <p>They head to the destroyed Trabia Garden, Selphie's home Garden, where Irvine tells everyone about their past together in the orphanage, which they had all forgotten (except for Irvine, of course) due to a side effect attributed to junctioning Guardian Forces: memory loss. Remembering their childhood, the team recognizes Sorceress Edea as their Matron, the woman who used to care for them in the orphanage, and decides to defeat her in spite of the past. The Garden embarks to the old orphanage in search for clues. </p>
          <p>Balamb Garden is intercepted by the similarly mobile Galbadia Garden and the Battle of the Gardens ensues. Squall leads Balamb's defense, at one point giving a heartfelt speech to Balamb's SeeDs and cadets, encouraging them to fight on. Squall and his team infiltrate Galbadia Garden and defeat Seifer and Edea, but Rinoa becomes comatose. It turns out Edea had been possessed by a sorceress from the future, Ultimecia, the whole time and did not act of her own free will. Ultimecia's goal is time compression to make herself a god-like being, but she needs to find Ellone to perform the spell and thus took over Edea to conquer Galbadia and use their manpower to find her. The SeeD's defeat over Edea snapped her out of the possession, and she divulges all she knows of Ultimecia to help them. </p>
          <p>Realizing he is in love with Rinoa, Squall searches for Ellone to have her send him back in time to prevent Rinoa becoming comatose. After learning from the White SeeD she has gone to Esthar, Squall decides to abandon the Garden and to take Rinoa to Esthar in secret. While crossing the Horizon Bridge Squall opens up to the unresponsive Rinoa on his deepest fears. When reaching the Seaside Station on the other side his party and Edea catch up with him, admonishing him for leaving them behind. The party makes its way into the mysterious nation of Esthar that has had no contact with the outside world for 17 years. </p>
          <p>After learning Ellone has gone to the Lunar Base Squall and Rinoa are sent to the Estharian space-station. Squall reunites with Ellone who is happy to learn he has recovered his childhood memories. He begs her to send him back in time so he can save Rinoa, but Ellone tells Squall she has learned it's impossible to change the past using her ability, as her numerous attempts with Squall and his friends resulted in naught but reliving the past. </p>
          <p>She still promises to try, but as Squall takes Ellone to the medical room Ultimecia possesses Rinoa and uses her to free Sorceress Adel from her space-bound tomb where she was kept to prevent her from passing on her sorceress power, and leaves Rinoa to die in space. The station is evacuated as the Lunar Cry begins and within the escape pod Squall asks Ellone to try again. Ellone sends Squall to Rinoa's consciousness where he tells her to activate the extra oxygen supply in her space suit. Ignoring everyone's warnings, Squall jumps into space to catch her. </p>
          <p>Squall and a cured Rinoa come across a derelict spaceship Ragnarok, which they use to return to the planet. Squall learns Rinoa has inherited Edea's sorceress power and become a sorceress, and the land base informs them Rinoa is to be seized upon returning to Esthar. </p>
          <p>Squall lets Esthar take Rinoa into custody, but after being talked into reason by his friends, he breaks into the Sorceress Memorial and frees her. The team heads back to Edea's Orphanage. Rinoa is pessimistic about the future, but Squall silently vows to be her knight even if all the world is her enemy. Squall and Rinoa promise to meet at the field behind the orphanage in case they should be parted. </p>
          <p>They are recalled to Esthar and find Laguna is Esthar's president and that Ellone has been taken captive inside the Estharian weapon Lunatic Pandora by the G-Army that now controls it. Laguna and the Estharian scientist Dr. Odine have concocted a plan to stop Ultimecia once and for all. Laguna follows Squall and his friends to the mission and within the Ragnarok Laguna's friends talk about Squall's parents, and Laguna, who has learned the whole story from Ellone—as the reason she had gone to Lunar Base was to meet with him—tells Squall they will have a lot to talk about later. </p>
          <p>They invade the Lunatic Pandora and save Ellone. After Fujin and Raijin unsuccessfully try to convince Seifer to stop serving Ultimecia, Squall and his friends fight through Seifer and shortly after, Adel, whose tomb had been swept up in the Lunar Cry and fallen to the Lunatic Pandora. With no other body to possess Ultimecia takes over Rinoa, which gives Ellone the opportunity to send Ultimecia's mind further back in time. Ultimecia begins the time compression allowing Squall and his friends to travel to the future and confront her. </p>
          <p>The final battle that traverses time and space, Ultimecia meets her demise. Time compression halts at Ultimecia's defeat and time begins to revert to its original form. A dying Ultimecia and Squall go back in time and appear at Edea's Orphanage where Squall meets Edea and implants the ideas of SeeD and Garden. After Ultimecia passes on her sorceress power to Edea, Squall falls back into the compressed time and tries to find his way back to the field where he and Rinoa promised to meet, but is trapped in a void. Rinoa uses her sorceress powers to find him and brings him back home. </p>
          <p>During a party at Balamb Garden to celebrate SeeD's victory over Ultimecia, Squall and Rinoa stay outside on a balcony overlooking the ocean. Under a shooting star Squall smiles at Rinoa and kisses her as the Garden flies under the moonlight. </p>
