          <p>Rinoa Heartilly (リノア・ハーティリー Rinoa Hātirī) is the primary female protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII. She is the 17-year-old[5] daughter of General Caraway, a high-ranking officer in the Galbadian army, and Julia Heartilly, a successful pianist and singer. Rinoa is a member of the Forest Owls, a resistance faction seeking to liberate the small nation of Timber from Galbadian occupation.[23][24] When Squall and his party of SeeD help the resistance movement fight Galbadia, Rinoa decides to stay with them; as a result she ends up falling in love with Squall.[18] She has black hair with brown highlights and dark eyes. Outspoken, spirited, emotional, and honest with her feelings, she speaks her mind without reservation.[5] Because of her ambition, she can often be stubborn.[5] The year before the game begins, she dated Squall's long-standing rival Seifer Almasy.[25]</p>
          <p>Rinoa first meets Squall at the SeeD inauguration ball at Balamb Garden. During the dance, she manages to charm the usually antisocial Squall[5] into dancing with her.[26] Her purpose for visiting the Garden is revealed when the Forest Owls hire Squall, Zell Dincht, and Selphie Tilmitt as mercenaries. Later, Rinoa is possessed by Ultimecia when she loses her influence over Sorceress Edea, which causes Rinoa to fall into a coma-like state. Consequently, Squall tries desperately to revive her, eventually traveling to the country of Esthar.[27] However, Ultimecia manages to use Rinoa to release Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison.[28] After Rinoa's use expires, Ultimecia possesses Adel and leaves Rinoa to die in space. Squall rescues her, and the two attempt to share a personal moment on the Ragnarok spaceship while the game's theme song, "Eyes On Me", plays in the background.[29][30] During the game's ending, she reunites with Squall, and kisses him for the first time on the Balamb Garden balcony. </p>
          <p>In battle, she uses a weapon called a "Blaster Edge",[31] which consists of an arm holster and a projectile that returns like a boomerang. In her Combine Limit Break, she attacks in unison with her dog, Angelo.[22] When Rinoa gains Sorceress powers, she acquires a second Limit Break, Angel Wing, which increases her spell-casting ability, along with rendering her in a state of "magic" berserk for the remainder of the battle.[32]</p>

          <h3 class="btn btn-dark col-sm-12 text-center">Concept and Design</h3>
          <div><hr class="hr-profile"/></div>
          <p>Character artist Tetsuya Nomura found Rinoa the hardest character to design in Final Fantasy VIII.[33] Nomura emphasized that he tried to avoid letting the possibilities presented by the recent advancements in full motion video technology become the entire focus, believing that these innovations might tempt developers to make their female characters "too beautiful" and focus more on physical appearance than personality. With this in mind, Nomura tried to make her "cute, not gorgeous". To further emphasize this, he wrote a list of vocabulary traits and physical habits for Rinoa's character that he felt conveyed this idea, and sent them to Kazushige Nojima along with the character's design.[8]</p>

          <h2 class="text-center text-light">Story Ahead. Contains Spoilers.</h2>
          <hr/>
          <p>Rinoa is the daughter of Galbadia's military commander Fury Caraway and idol singer Julia Heartilly. When Rinoa was almost five, Julia died in a car accident and afterwards, Rinoa and her father grew steadily apart. At 16, Rinoa dated a SeeD cadet named Seifer Almasy from whom she learned more of the mercenary-for-hire service SeeD provides. By the time she is seventeen, Rinoa has moved away from home and presumably changed her surname to her mother's maiden name. To compound their problems, Rinoa joined the Forest Owls, a group of freedom fighters rebelling against the Galbadian government. </p>
          <p>Rinoa meets Squall during the SeeD inauguration party at Balamb Garden where she gets him to dance. Rinoa is on an errand on behalf of the Owls to convince Headmaster Cid Kramer to employ SeeD mercenaries to aid their cause. With Seifer's help she is introduced to Cid and, hearing her plight, he allows her the use of a group of three SeeDs despite the meager payment she offers in return and the complaints of the Garden Faculty. </p>
          <p>The three SeeDs chosen are Zell Dincht, Selphie Tilmitt, and Squall Leonhart. While disappointed Seifer is not part of the squad, Rinoa is nonetheless elated SeeD has come to the Owls' aid. The SeeDs at first willingly assist in Rinoa's plans to kidnap Vinzer Deling, the president of Galbadia, by hijacking his train. When the president they kidnap turns out to be a fake the SeeDs' confidence in the Timber group begins to wane. </p>
          <p>They learn the real president will make an announcement at the Timber TV Station and the Forest Owls hatch a new plan with their SeeD mercenaries watching skeptically from a distance. Squall requests to see the contract that bounds his group to the Owls, only to discover they are under Rinoa's command as long as Timber remains under Galbadian oppression. Rinoa wants them to take over the newly-activated TV Station to broadcast a message of sedition, but while on their way to infiltrate the station new intelligence indicates that, due to the military presence, the plan needs to be abandoned. Squall expresses the SeeD group's misgivings of being part of such a casual organization and questions Rinoa's commitment. The argument ends with her leaving. </p>
          <p>During the president's TV broadcast a renegade Seifer takes him hostage over the air. Squall, Selphie and Zell rush to the studio to aid Squall's former teacher Quistis who had been pursuing Seifer. Seifer is spirited away by Sorceress Edea, the president's new ally he was supposed to announce as the nation's new ambassador. Having seen the incident on the Timber TV Station screen, and discovering the Forest Owls' base destroyed, Rinoa returns looking for Seifer and the rest. </p>
          <p>Arriving too late to find him, she orders the SeeDs to help her lie low while the Galbadian forces search the town. Contemplating Seifer's fate leads Squall and Rinoa into another argument over their views on life before they are given word it is clear to leave town. Unable to return to Balamb Garden, the group heads to the Galbadia Garden instead. En route the two argue again, this time about Squall's cold attitude towards his teammates. Squall, Selphie, and Quistis mysteriously fall unconscious, and when they awaken, Rinoa, feeling guilty for being so hard on him, apologizes. </p>
          <p>The group makes it to the Garden and learns Seifer has been announced executed. Rinoa reveals her past with him and the SeeDs receive new orders. Rinoa pretends to be a SeeD to avoid conflict and joins Squall's group in heading to Deling City to meet their contact, Rinoa's father, General Caraway. After meeting with the SeeDs General Caraway locks Rinoa in another room and informs the SeeDs of his plan to assassinate Sorceress Edea. </p>
          <p>After the briefing Rinoa escapes the room, having discovered a rare Odine Bangle in a drawer. She rushes to Quistis to tell her of her plan to stop the sorceress by tricking her to wear the bangle said to suppress a sorceress's powers. Quistis berates her, thinking Rinoa's plan is only contrived to oppose her father. Left to her own devices, Rinoa carries out her plan alone. She infiltrates the Presidential Residence and offers the bangle to Edea as a gift. Edea renders Rinoa under her control like a puppet, and Rinoa placidly follows Edea out onto the balcony where she is designated as a sacrifice for Edea's coronation ceremony. </p>
          <p>Edea summons two Iguions to attack Rinoa, but Squall and Irvine, a G-Garden sharpshooter who is to aid them assassinate the sorceress, save her. Squall has discovered Seifer is alive and has become Edea's sorceress' knight, meaning he may have to kill him, something Rinoa feels ambivalent over. After Squall fights Seifer Rinoa and Irvine join him against Edea who renders Squall unconscious with an ice javelin. As he falls off the parade float Rinoa fruitlessly reaches out to him. The group is captured and imprisoned in the D-District Prison, barred by Irvine who escaped. Irvine returns, acting on orders from presumably Rinoa's father, to retrieve Rinoa from imprisonment and, with tenacious convincing from her, the pair assists the rest of the group's escape from the compound. </p>
          <p>During their capture, the group learns that in retaliation for the attack on Sorceress Edea, Galbadia has targeted Balamb and Trabia Gardens in a missile attack. Splitting into two the party attempts to prevent the attack: Selphie's plan is to sabotage the missiles aimed at Balamb Garden, while Squall rushes to warn the Garden of the impending attack. It is up to Squall to place Rinoa in either group. If Rinoa is sent to the Missile Base she assists the group in the base's destruction, but the missiles are launched regardless. If Squall takes Rinoa to Balamb Garden, she helps him find the headmaster during a riot and activate the Garden's mobile functions to move the Garden away from the spot the missiles were programmed to target. After everything calms down Rinoa asks Squall to give her a tour of the Garden. </p>
          <p>The party is reunited in Fishermans Horizon where the mobile Balamb Garden crashes. Squall acts as an ambassador and enacts a formal apology, but Mayor Dobe, the leader of the pacifist city, tells them to leave as their presence can only cause destruction. Galbadian soldiers invade the town and Dobe heads off to discuss peacefully with them. The soldiers do not listen, and Dobe is rescued by Squall and his team. Grudgingly, the mayor accepts their apology, and orders the city's technicians to restore Balamb Garden to full functionality. Selphie's group reunites with Squall and for a moment Squall is almost elated, something that does not go unnoticed by Rinoa. </p>
          <p>Squall is appointed commander of SeeD and to celebrate his friends organize a concert for his honor. If Rinoa doesn't like the band's music she argues with Squall and runs away. If Rinoa enjoys the music she convinces Squall to trust in his friends more. </p>
          <p>As his first command Squall liberates Balamb from Galbadian occupation. Next they head to the ruins of Trabia Garden, Selphie's home Garden, where he offers the students Balamb Garden's support. While waiting for Selphie, Rinoa voices her worries about being an interloper and a burden within the group and what would happen in the future. The others recollect their pasts and discover they were raised in the same orphanage and that Edea—Headmaster Cid's wife—is the Matron who used to look after them. </p>
          <p>The Garden embarks to Edea's Orphanage in search of clues, but is intercepted by a similarly mobile Galbadia Garden. The Battle of the Gardens ensues, and Rinoa falls off the Garden's edge, but Squall rides a Galbadian jetpack to save her and regroup with the others inside the enemy Garden. Rinoa asks Squall about his lion ring, as she is holding it for him, having obtained it from Zell for safekeeping. Squall explains it symbolizes pride and courage, and Rinoa ponders if she can become a lion too. </p>
          <p>Sorceress Edea is defeated and Rinoa starts acting strange: she revives a defeated Seifer before collapsing. Edea had been possessed by another sorceress from the future known as Ultimecia, but being defeated by SeeD snapped her out of it and she becomes the SeeD's ally. </p>
          <p>Rinoa remains comatose and her condition concerns Squall who realizes he is in love with her, driving him to seek a cure. He knows Ellone, a girl he used to know from the orphanage he was raised in, can send people's consciousnesses back in time. Squall searches for her to ask her to send him in Rinoa's past to discover what happened to her. Being led to Esthar, Squall and Rinoa are sent to the Lunar Base space station to meet Ellone. </p>
          <p>Rinoa awakens under the control of Ultimecia, as after being defeated, Edea had unknowingly passed on her sorceress power to Rinoa. Ultimecia uses Rinoa to unlock Sorceress Adel's spacebound tomb and leaves Rinoa to die in space. Cured from her coma, Rinoa ponders her impending demise before Squall contacts her telepathically with Ellone's help, telling her to activate the emergency oxygen supply of her spacesuit. Squall ditches his escape pod from the Lunar Base that is being destroyed by the Lunar Cry and intercepts Rinoa in space. The two discover the derelict Ragnarok airship that was floating aimlessly in space near them. </p>
          <p>On board the Ragnarok Squall communicates their current situation to Esthar Air Station, and enables the ship's autopilot to return to the planet. Squall confesses many things to Rinoa about himself and Rinoa tells him he is the one who gives her the most comfort and happiness. The land base tells the two Rinoa will be seized by the Esthar government upon landing because she has become a sorceress. </p>
          <p>Esthar officials take Rinoa to contain her sorceress powers in a new tomb in the Sorceress Memorial, like what they had done to Sorceress Adel before her. Fearing she would hurt anyone else or be hated by society, Rinoa allows her powers to be sealed. After being pushed into action by his friends, Squall breaks into the Sorceress Memorial as Rinoa is about to be cryogenically frozen, and takes her away with him to Edea's Orphanage. </p>
          <p>In the flower field behind the orphanage Rinoa voices her concerns about being possessed and turning evil, but Squall makes a silent vow to become Rinoa's sorceress' knight. Rinoa asks Squall to kill her should her worst fears come to reality, but Squall assures his enemy is Ultimecia alone. Rinoa tells Squall of a nightmare she had in which she wanted to see him, but could not find him. The couple promises to meet at the flower field should they be separated. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Joining forces with Esthar, the SeeDs devise a plan to defeat Ultimecia. They invade the Lunatic Pandora on the Ragnarok and fight through Seifer and an awakened Sorceress Adel (now Ultimecia's vessel). Ultimecia orders Seifer to capture Rinoa, who is junctioned to Adel's body through Ultimecia's powers. Squall and the others defeat Adel who passes on her sorceress power to Rinoa. Ultimecia possesses Rinoa and Ellone sends Ultimecia and Rinoa back in time so Ultimecia can cast time compression, a magic spell only possible to cast if the sorceress's consciousness simultaneously exists in the past, present, and future. </p>
          <p>The process of time compression is long, and allows for Squall, Rinoa, Zell, Quistis, Irvine, and Selphie to enter Ultimecia Castle in the future and defeat Ultimecia. The time compression unravels leaving the combatants stranded in time and they make their way back by remembering who they are and where they want to be. Rinoa reappears in the flower field where she and Squall had made their promise, but Squall is nowhere to be found. Using her sorceress powers, Rinoa transforms a flower petal into a feather that finds Squall in a void, trapped between time. She follows him to the void and brings him back to the flower field. </p>
          <p>Balamb Garden celebrates SeeD's victory over Ultimecia and Squall and Rinoa stay outside on a balcony overlooking the ocean. Noticing a shooting star, much as the one he had seen on the night the pair first met, Squall smiles at Rinoa and kisses her as the Garden flies under the moonlight. </p>
